"Greed-for lack of better word is-Good, greed is right, greed works, greed clarifies, cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all it's forms. Greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge- has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed-you mark my words- will not only save teldar paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the U.S.A.... thank you very much.Gordon Gekko.•ÈÀ"
I love holly wood directors they are so innovative•ÈÀ
Phenomenal movie. One of the best of all time.•ÈÀ

"Gordon Gekko was a good man.  Bud Fox was ungrateful little cockroach.  The real criminals aren't people who bust out crap companies that no one is going to give a shit about in two years, the real criminals are the politicians who busted out this country and put us $19 trillion dollars in the hole and counting.  When are the politicians in Washington, D.C. going to get arrested for treason and put in orange jump suits?•ÈÀ"
u mad bra?•ÈÀ
Who do you think would get the blame and prison time once the sec came down on Gekko? he would have put it all on bud so he was using him to do the dirty work.•ÈÀ
Owen Daniels You can't say it any better than that sport but sadly no body has the balls to tell that to the bastards in Washington ! if only their was more people  like you•ÈÀ
"+WangDiddy82 i get your point, that's how the people wrote the script...gordon was the movie villian so they have him talk a lot of sense during the movie but then he's doing these underhanded things, setting up bud fox to take the fall...so i'm speaking generally not within the entire context of this oliver stone-written movie..•ÈÀ"
great movie but did not see wall Street 2•ÈÀ
you dont miss a thing... this one is milles better than WS2•ÈÀ
"The iMac was nice - but why the uncomfortable to the point of being painful, hockey puck shaped mouse?•ÈÀ"

GREED RULEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS!!!•ÈÀ
MONEY RULESSSS!!!!•ÈÀ
"stupid... buddy is fucked :))Geeko RULLEEESSS!!!!!•ÈÀ"
"Awesome movie. Wagged the day of school to see it back in 1987! Greed is not good, but this movie is! Good cast, great acting.•ÈÀ"

Cool•ÈÀ
Charlie Sheen has no emotions in his acting .•ÈÀ
"maybe that is what's different from him to other actors, im not fan of sheen but maybe thats why he is great•ÈÀ"

Piece of cake Gordon stockbrokers are bla bla bla all day? stressing job men•ÈÀ

"What a great movie, 10x better than its pretenders - Money never sleeps and Wolf of Wall Street.•ÈÀ"
"What's the music? Its a classic piece of famous composer, but i can't remember the name. :)•ÈÀ"
"+Jan Smekens Its a modified version of Valdis Four Seasons, Winter•ÈÀ"
I don/t like Oliver's tone.•ÈÀ

"I forgot the Italians as well.  Sorry, here is the clarification and profiling of NYC gangs:Jewish; Catholics: Irish, Latin: Puerto Rican, Cuban, Italians, and the others; Dutch; and you; the unknown individuals (getting crushed, I predicted?).•ÈÀ"
"I can imagine the wars between local gangs versus out of staters, the Ivy graduates, just to get that lucrative job, which pay the average of $100,000 a year.They could get you late for work, slash your tire, attack your family and children, forcing you to move, and other things.

I think the factions in NYC are now: Jewish, Catholics: Irish, Latin: Puerto Rican, Cuban, and the others,  Dutch, and you, the unknown individuals (getting crushed, I predicted?).•ÈÀ"
"And because they used to be poor, they likened the policy of high tax, big government spending, union or more factious, bribery, corruptions.  NYC is not your meritocracy, no sir, it have become a blend of capitalism icon surrounded by agents of socialism and communist.  Looked at today SP 500 corporations, (which are owned piece wise by funds, banks, and big pocket investors) looked at the CFO, CEO.  Dude, and you said it is not pride and prejudice, and factious?•ÈÀ"
"Is it like that in real life?  here goes the history lesson, after WWs, influx of immigrants to NYC, the city became factious than ever.  I mean looked at the people on Wall Street.  Do they looked like white to you?  I think most of the old timers moved their families to the Midwest, Chicago, and further west, leaving these people behind, who doesn't know how to run anything.  •ÈÀ"

@Talentz92But actually wouldn't it be true that what truly is going on in banking was an inspiration for this movie. It was reality of banking  that gave live to fictional figure of Gordon Gekko and not vice versa•ÈÀ
I wonder what kind of apps he gets on that cell phone•ÈÀ
@Talentz92  is true I got inspired by it hmmm love the stock since I was 13 :) worked day and night for it till it payed off with or with out the inside information :) wall street materialism at its finest it gave a lot of  hard labor  years of sleepless nights eventual hell and in the end  pleasure.•ÈÀ

EH?  I thought Micheal Douglas's ancestors were from Russia.•ÈÀ
@JuanMacready why would you say that you fucking troll•ÈÀ

@mansitopinta If you liked Wall Street 2 I am sure you will enjoy the first movie as well. It was made back in the golden yuppie-days of the 1980's and you also get to see alot more business and high finance than you do in the sequel. I love both movies though.•ÈÀ
"The character of Gordon Gekko was meant to be portrayed as a villain.........instead he became an icon for capitalism!  The famous quote ""Greed is good"" is ranked 10th in the top 100 best quotes of all time........just behind the Terminators ""Ill be back""  at no. 9.•ÈÀ"
"Tom Cruise wanted to play the part of Bud Fox, but Charlie Sheen had already been signed up.  Apparently Oliver stone tore what was left of his hair out when he found out he could of had Cruise for the part...he would have been good too...like in the Firm.   And Micheal Douglas was only the third choice as Gekko..Stone wanted Warren Beatty and then Richard Gere(both refusing) and only as a last minute resort turned to Douglas, who they were worried might be miscast.......the agony of hindsight!•ÈÀ"

"I agree that Hollywood has lost its creativity. Most of its ""Blockbusters"" are revisited 80's etc movies or direct adaptations of foreign films, which are renamed and packaged as original products (eg The Departed and the Chaser (more than likely). It's pretty sad, but some of the best movies being made today are from Asia or Europe, where budgets are lower but innovation is much higher. Not a coincidence. I hoped the recession would be good for films, but just bred more rehashes instead...•ÈÀ"
lol i keep seeing the trailer i love the host voice 2 XD•ÈÀ
@RidiculousThoughts1 Yep it is. •ÈÀ
"Harping back to a time when hollywood made great films. I think Hollywood has lost it's creativity now and produces 10th rate movies now. You may find the odd exception but on the whole creativity and imagination not just in the movies has taken a nose dive. Poor acting, poor scripts, poor dialogue too much emphasis on special effects. The 80's although a decade of outrageous fashion and excess was a great decade for movies and music. Today bears no comparison it is boring and lifeless.•ÈÀ"

awesome movie!! i read somewhere that O. Stone was trying to expose this crooked lifestyle and what happens to ppl who engage in it......and he was dissapointed that so many actually used fox and gecko as role models. the opposite of what he intended from the film. 80s decadence at its best•ÈÀ
And the fact that Gecko gets his monstrous cell phone back when he gets out of Prison in Wall Street 2•ÈÀ
