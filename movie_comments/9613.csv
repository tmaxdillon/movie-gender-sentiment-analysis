Hopefullu this movie doesn't suck. It looks like it will do well•ÈÀ
1:36 HELLO-!•ÈÀ
He committed not feel so good•ÈÀ
"Hopefully there is a Stan lee cameo...R.I.P•ÈÀ"
;-;•ÈÀ
When is it coming December 14 or Christmas•ÈÀ
is spider-man 2099 in this movie?•ÈÀ
1:40 WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RUIN IT•ÈÀ
Octavio Percivaldi how did that ruin it•ÈÀ
The guy who voices peter is nick from New Girl!!!•ÈÀ
HOW DOES HE NOT REMEMBER GWEN YOU WERE BEST FRIENDS YEARS AGO REMEMBER??•ÈÀ
"sigPlayzRoblox nothing indicates that he doesn‰Ûªt remember, it still could be in the movie•ÈÀ"
why is he the same age from the disney xd version. and peter is all grown up. help me understand•ÈÀ
sigPlayzRoblox because why not•ÈÀ
Amazing movie. I try draw Gwen Tracy and her team in my channel guys. Search YouTube: spider Gwen studio atistika. I was draw Miles Morales too•ÈÀ
I first saw the trailer in theaters! I love John Mulaney!!‰_•ü_ÙÕª•ÈÀ
Let‰Ûªs actually just replace all white male actors with every major role with either a woman or literally any other race .... I mean it would just be considered racist otherwise•ÈÀ
huh?•ÈÀ
Dube Za replace? This is a different character from an alternate universe.•ÈÀ
Finally we see a black Spiderman•ÈÀ
Miles has been around since before thd whole childish gambino thing•ÈÀ
She‰Ûªs peng•ÈÀ
Time to neco Stan Lee•ÈÀ
"Anime grill, sold.•ÈÀ"
If Silk is in this gotta rate it PG13 Maybe R due to Pete's and her pheromones•ÈÀ
"TheBeastly Champ No, that‰Ûªs not even close enough to get it PG13. Let alone R.•ÈÀ"
"@szeax if you read the comic Cindy and Pete get bit frisky time to time, they where both bit by the same spider causing them to have the same pheromones thus attracting them a bit more to each other. So PG 13 rated due to/if Cindy will be added•ÈÀ"
2:28 Wakanda?•ÈÀ
"For all Peni Parker lovers...I present to you the replay button!!1:37•ÈÀ"
Where supaidaman at my boi leopardon and takuya•ÈÀ
Is it actually stop motion or cgi?•ÈÀ
Cheeky Bum cgi•ÈÀ
What‰Ûªs the BGM?•ÈÀ
I love how they're in their own art style‰_•ÈÀ
I got a trailer before a trailer•ÈÀ
Spider Porker my childhood hero•ÈÀ
why the video look like its lagging.....•ÈÀ
"Not seeing this.Because The Amazing Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Spiderman Homecoming. Is better.•ÈÀ"
"EWicken you know.. how? You haven‰Ûªt seen this movie, how do you know it‰Ûªs bad?•ÈÀ"
This looks like a curious movie like if u agree•ÈÀ
"Can't wait for watching this spider vers!!! For the note spider Chan beautifully awesome Mantulll Mantab jiwaaa•ÈÀ"
"This movie was doing great, until Peter porker showed up.•ÈÀ"
Yung Butterstick and that helped the sales•ÈÀ
The name of the song?•ÈÀ
They should also include Megal O'Hara: Spider-Man 2099 in this movie. Don't you think?•ÈÀ
Facts•ÈÀ
"""why are my frames dropping?""•ÈÀ"
i got the same ad.•ÈÀ
When is it coming out ????•ÈÀ
I HAVE TO SEE THIS•ÈÀ
Peter Parker stills love Mary Jane Watson  and not Gwen Stacy and they share a kiss which looks like a scene from spider man 1 he has a picture of her so that proves Mary Jane Watson the one for Peter Parker take that Gwen Stacy and Parker other love interest•ÈÀ
Ryan Rodgers no•ÈÀ
szeax what do you mean•ÈÀ
1:39 look be hind ant may / spider may lol and you see the ps4 spider man symbol•ÈÀ

before watching this I got an ad... for into the spiderverse... nice job YouTube•ÈÀ
+1 for piggy spider•ÈÀ
I wanna like this but it looks like they mixed CG with stop-motion and that just kills it for me•ÈÀ
masterofinfinity479 it‰Ûªs just CG... It just seems like stop motion because of how choppy it is.•ÈÀ
"for some reason, peter looks like default guy•ÈÀ"
"In that last scene Peni Parker isn't sticking to the ceiling with her hands like the others. I guess she doesn't have spider powers like the others, she just drives that power suit.•ÈÀ"
"Kindred Vids well, it‰Ûªs pretty known that she doesn‰Ûªt have standard powers.•ÈÀ"
"I stopped watching this shitty trailer after seeing the BLACK peter parker.... Seriously, I'm not being racist here. I think we are just going too far to appease the lower class race. Enough is enough! What's next? are we going to have a Spider Muslim or Spider Jihad?•ÈÀ"
"Oz One can‰Ûªt tell if this is a joke or nah, but that‰Ûªs not peter Parker. His name is miles, has been in comics for awhile•ÈÀ"
Oz One stop.•ÈÀ
There are two white Peter Parkers in this trailer. Tf you talking about?•ÈÀ

"hey so are we gonna ignore the fact that meal cost $30,000•ÈÀ"

I would've liked it better if it was live action with Tom Holland and maybe Michael B Jordan as Miles Morales•ÈÀ

@ILoveJapan28A yea ik but that's just my wishful thinking_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ

Spidey kid?•ÈÀ
"""The truth is... I knew a Gwen Stacy in my universe.""I'd never have imagined that this movie would actually get me emotional.•ÈÀ"
Yees Spider-Man noir•ÈÀ
So so? They're fucking delicious and a mystery to find outside of ice cream men.•ÈÀ
#SONYKILLS #WHYSONY #UFAKEDMJ•ÈÀ
No one wondering how there gonna deal with the fact spider noir flat out kills people and fit it into a kids movie•ÈÀ
Cade Washa the same way they fit deadpool into Spider-Man cartoons.•ÈÀ
@szeax so by making him lame•ÈÀ
"Cade Washa no, deadpool was still pretty cool there.•ÈÀ"
"uhhhh..you are aware that you should not feel guilty for slavery man..... having a black Spiderman is so fucking wrong bro.what's next .....white guy playing tchalla.I been collecting comics since 1984•ÈÀ"
"Safet Cucaj but it is not Peter Parker who‰Ûªs black it‰Ûªs just Miles Morales , who became Spider Man.Btw, there were white Black Panthers.•ÈÀ"
"Wait, so you have been collecting comics since 1984 but yet you seem not to know that Miles exists in the Comics since like 9 years, or am i not getting something here? ( Plus it's Spider-Man and not Spiderman)•ÈÀ"
Safet Cucaj also there is a white tchalla lmao•ÈÀ
"""I've been collecting comics since 1984""Seems you don't read them since you don't know that Miles has existed for almost a decade at this point•ÈÀ"
He reminds me so much of junior _Ù÷Ò‰_•ü R.I.P ‰_•ü•ÈÀ
why tf is he black? what a desperate attempt to please liberals. Its so forced to just create a black character to be spider man like this.•ÈÀ
Aura Companion please tell me you‰Ûªre trolling•ÈÀ
"Miles has been a character in the comics since 2009. Also, There are three spider-men in this movie, two of them being white•ÈÀ"
Im finna clap peni parker _Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷•ÈÀ
subzero8901 I genuinely hope your grave gets pissed on•ÈÀ
"Hey, does anyone notice that Peni Parker in 2:22 is holding her skirt down?•ÈÀ"
"Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig, does whatever a Spider-Pig does.•ÈÀ"
Nice•ÈÀ
From all the scenes of Peter Parker it seems he's like Tobey Maguire.•ÈÀ
Mr stark I don't feel so good•ÈÀ
Just got an ad for this movie!•ÈÀ
I want to see this movie•ÈÀ
anime uwu•ÈÀ

"szeax look, just because I have a different opinion on something doesn‰Ûªt make me blind. I just don‰Ûªt like stupid jokes and plots that look retarded, but hey maybe other people like that kind of stuff.•ÈÀ"
It looks great!•ÈÀ
Spidermans black?•ÈÀ
Kaaniman this one is.•ÈÀ

I had an ad for this ad•ÈÀ
LOL GOT SPIDERVERSE AD AND THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING THE REAL THING!•ÈÀ
I can see a detail on Miles‰Ûª hip on his suit•ÈÀ
I'm hyped but this made me cringe a bit. Like why did they make spidergwen do all these ballerina moves idk it's weird•ÈÀ
"What ""balleria moves"" those are spiderman moves scrub•ÈÀ"
"Ah yes, the classic ballerina move where they fucking swing into alternate universes and fight crime.•ÈÀ"
"@Dieselnaut 3.0 look at 1:45 the way she lands. And she's also wearing ballerinas, scrub•ÈÀ"
@Lex_ I dont think ballerinas land like that when they jump off a building•ÈÀ
TAY K GOT OUTTA PRISON YO•ÈÀ
"Justified Slash PUT DOWN THE GUN, TAY.•ÈÀ"
I don't know if anyone else noticed that it looks to me like there's less frames per second.•ÈÀ
Nobody talking about the fact that we finally got a black Spiderman I'm so proud•ÈÀ
"Nobodys talking about it cause miles has been around for years, everyone knows him already, weve had a black spiderman for ages•ÈÀ"
1:04 inflation is ridiculous in this universe•ÈÀ
I dont remember anime being in the Disney XD show•ÈÀ
HeyThatsMe _ because that show picked a different group of characters•ÈÀ
What song is this•ÈÀ
Sorry I was there when Amazing Fantasy #15 first hit the stands. There has never been a decent Spider-Man movie.•ÈÀ
The Joker no. That‰Ûªs just wrong.•ÈÀ
You definitely weren't•ÈÀ
Ok we are seeing black Spiderman and black Pokemon master in Pokemon detection Pikachu !!! All for colour representation ‰ª´•ü. When is Indian Spiderman coming ??! I am waiting....•ÈÀ
This isnt a new character•ÈÀ
Is it just me or does anyone realize that at 2:18 Peter's sounds like the sound of Tobey Maguire_Ù÷± even at 0:58 and 1:02 too!•ÈÀ
It's like shattered dimensions.•ÈÀ
I. Got a. Spider-Man ad•ÈÀ
"Spiderman is now a LoliLadies and Gentlemen, we got 'em.•ÈÀ"
Sebastian Acosta we got... who?•ÈÀ

"Yeah, 'tis true. @szeax I'm just glad they finally made an interUniverse cross over WITH ACTUALLY DIFFERENT ART STYLES.•ÈÀ"
@szeax And I believe you mostly because of the Junko profile picture. lol•ÈÀ
ooh! Toei Japanese Spider-Man reference at 1:37•ÈÀ
Not really•ÈÀ
Spider-Man 2099 has to atleast have a cameo in this one.•ÈÀ
0:46 what males saying brookylon or front flip•ÈÀ
Dan the gaming master 123 Brooklyn•ÈÀ
I got an into the spiderverse ad before I wanted to watch the trailer•ÈÀ
Love the animation•ÈÀ
I can‰Ûªt believe it . Peter Porker is now in a movie ! Peter Porker is Spider Ham for the marvel fans who don‰Ûªt read the comics and only knows the Avengers . He was in comics a long time ago . Still have some of the issues .•ÈÀ
I just got an add about this•ÈÀ
I got a Spider-Man ad•ÈÀ
I had the trailer before this one•ÈÀ
"I wanna watch this. The animation and the story makes it so interesting. Also, the comedy is clever.•ÈÀ"
Got an ad for the movie before watching this trailer•ÈÀ
I saw SpiderMan PS4 suit in the trailer•ÈÀ
oh ini yang kemarin di akhir film venom•ÈÀ
Why a black spider man!!!?•ÈÀ

Took you 9 years to complain. Miles has existed since 2009•ÈÀ
Framerate at a solid 10FPS :(•ÈÀ
0:22 so nobody's going to bring up the Yugo ad?•ÈÀ
Andrew Duong no•ÈÀ
PSA: nicolas cage is the voice of spiderman noir•ÈÀ
Can someone tell me what's going on with the anime character? Are they another spiderman? I can't even tell their gender :'D•ÈÀ
"Cat Poke it‰Ûªs a girl, she is Peni Parker. She doesn‰Ûªt have spider powers, but she was bitten by a spider that lets her control a mecha-spiderman called SP//dr. (That‰Ûªs the big robot thing that she jumps on)•ÈÀ"
"Best Spider-Man movie, it has kingpin gg•ÈÀ"
Anyone else realize the voice of Spider-Man is nick miller from new girl?•ÈÀ
Is the pig John Mulaney?•ÈÀ
Vaughn Perry yes•ÈÀ
this looks amazing•ÈÀ
"I so desperately want miles' life he has the girl,the powers, the grades hes a god among us•ÈÀ"
This.is.awesome.•ÈÀ
I got 2 free tickets to this movie from being a PS Plus member. Anyone else•ÈÀ
Yeah same•ÈÀ
"Alright this looks cool but it's really confusing. I mean what universes are peter and miles from? Is this Earth-616 Spider-Man and Earth-1610 Spider-Man or did they create a whole new multiverse? If so, are all of those universes have their own Earth numbers? It's really bugging me•ÈÀ"
Ozan GÌÏNER it doesn‰Ûªt matter.•ÈÀ
"If it isn't in comic form, it isn't 616. Also, 1610 is gone dude.•ÈÀ"
"@UniqueNameGuy i don't agree. although it's clearly not 616 Spider-Man, i still think if it fits the 616 canon, it could very well be 616 Spider-Man. And i know 1610 was destroyed but Spider-Verse storyline takes place before that happened•ÈÀ"
@szeax well it does to me. I'm really interested in this multiverse thing•ÈÀ
"@Ozan GÌÏNER I say this can't be 616, not because it doesn't fit the canon (although it doesn't) but because every tv show, movie and game involving Spider-Man is an alternate universe. Regardless of how closely it approximates another universe, if it isn't told in the comics with main spidey, it isn't main canon. Though I doubt it'll be made into a comic, all of these characters are alternate versions of the alternate versions in the comics. Another thing to point out is that time passes at the same speed in all universes but Peter and Miles are nowhere remotely similar in age and Peni is too young. It wouldn't make sense for these to be the official versions of these characters•ÈÀ"

"Finally a Spider-man movie that tries something new, even if it's Pixar cartoonish! Seems original, a cool way to bring some different versions of Spider-man together! I just hope they allow every character it's screen time, not just focus on the other guys when the main center is Miles, or too be focused too much on Miles and the other characters to be just as supporting cast!•ÈÀ"

"Christian Jardin  it's an alternate universe, Spider-Man is still white, THIS one is just black. There are infinite spidermen, it shouldn't be a surprise that there's at least one black one. Also this character existed before the PC and SJW era.•ÈÀ"
"@szeax I'll take your word for it but never read, heard or saw infinite spidermen•ÈÀ"
"Christian Jardin infinite universes, infinite spidermen. That's just how the multiverse works in marvel, dude.•ÈÀ"
"@szeax you explained it wrong. It's supposed to be Miles Morales. If it was a multi-verse. Then there would be a White Black Panther, a White Blade and a White Storm. And that would be non-sensical after a while.•ÈÀ"
"Christian Jardin All the things you listed exist, pal.•ÈÀ"
@szeax in a hypothetical world anything is impossible. But it's non-sensical to view Storm as White just because there's a multi verse. Character development just goes out the window. It becomes chicken scratch if you will.•ÈÀ
Christian Jardin but there has literally been white versions of storm in the marvel multiverse.•ÈÀ
@Christian Jardin Spider-Verse. Search it up. It was a huge event based around the idea of infinite spider-people•ÈÀ

I till can't believe that the big man himself is gone....and at 95 no less....he always seemed like he had another 20 years in him.....I know this was probably inspired by the Mobile game but I'm going to go see this non the less just to see Peters reaction when he sees that that his first GF is spider-gwen•ÈÀ
Nick Lancial it was inspired by the comics..•ÈÀ
@szeax I'm sure the popularity of the mobile game also had some influence ....I do remember as a kid that there was a short arc in the cartoon where he teamed up with  other spidermen to stop spider-carnage•ÈÀ

KmpKingTM 843 That comment just sounded so racist also people cant be stupid enough to watch this and not realize that miles is from the comics•ÈÀ
"@CrappyBogish[DCUO][DBXV2][ETC,] how is my comment racist?  And people are that dumb.  They had no idea who miles was until thus movie•ÈÀ"
KmpKingTM 843 i dont care  if hes miles all i care is that the character is a fken negger !•ÈÀ
@Cuban Richh lol ok and? Still didnt state the problem at hand skeez _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
"@KmpKingTM 843  Meh, it's about forced political correctness. If this movie came out 5 years ago, no one would've cared about that. But as you know,  recent years have been forcing everyone to become either 1. A member of LGQBT 2. A member of a miniority group 3. Of a different race (Other than white) or 4. Being a female. For example, I didn't watch Black Panther 2018 because it's so full of politics (Which spoiled it for me), yet I was a big fan of Black Panther comics and cartoons growing up. So it kills it for me when people suggest James Bond or the example with Ghost Buster 2016 either needing or having a female or black person because certain people are yelling ""poor black people and females"".•ÈÀ"
@Dan yes I understand where your coming from my guy.  But miles has been in the comics for years now.  It's only until now he's been put into a movie.•ÈÀ
"Dan Miles has been a comic book character for almost a decade now. No one is creating him because of all the political stuff going on. Spider-Verse was a real comic series too, and it featured a lot more spider-men than there will be in this new film•ÈÀ"

"Nameless Nerd Funnily enough, there was a recent story where Miles and Peter discover there actually was a Miles Morales in the 616 Universe, who WAS a gangster.•ÈÀ"
"@Dan Totally right.  I mean, other than Superman, Batman, Robin, the Flash, Iron Man, Captain America, Deadpool, Cable, Thor, Hulk, Dr. Strange, Daredevil, the Punisher, Wolverine... there's just no white guys anymore•ÈÀ"

"Just look at all these hypocrites in comment section! When Steve Ditko died( without whom Spider Man wouldn‰Ûªt exist as we know him) , no one even mentioned it. Now, when Stan Lee dies, everybody goes apeshit.•ÈÀ"
"AluTheHungryGhost I wouldn't say it's there fault, Stan Lee was just more popular in general.•ÈÀ"
"But Stan Lee did a lot for the Marvel Universe in general. He created it. While this might be a spider-man video, they aren't only remembering his contribution to spider-man•ÈÀ"
"@UniqueNameGuy  He didn't create Marvel Universe. The universe was already established in 1940 with crossover between Human Torch and Namor, year before Stan Lee wrote his first story. And when we are talking about creation of Avengers, Fantastic Four and all others characters that got popular in 60s, they were created in collaboration with Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and others. In fact, when Kirby left the company in 1970, Lee suddenly stopped writing stories at all.•ÈÀ"
@AluTheHungryGhost A crossover between 2 characters does not equate to a universe in and of itself.  The fact that he established many different characters and tgeir relations to each other in a shared world is the point.•ÈÀ
"@UniqueNameGuy  It does. It establishes that those two characters exist in the same world. They were followed by lots of other crossovers and even creation of superhero team ""All-Winner Squad"" which had Captain America, Bucky, Miss America, Destroyer, Human Torch and Toro, Whizzer and many other heroes, with relationships( although not that significant, because you know, 40s). Furthermore we had characters like Citizen V, Thunderer,  the Finand other characters from ""Daring Mystery Comics"" series which also existed in the very same world.•ÈÀ"

"So from what I can see, there's two Gwen Stacys. One is from another universe, the Spiderwoman, or white widow if you will. But, the other character is confusing me. I'm pretty sure this is another Gwen, or it could just be another character altogether. I'm imagining her as the sitting in the tree comics where the two get married, or marvel could be using some Earth 616 non-Ultimate cannon and throwing pre-carnage Gwen in there? One gwen has blue eyes, a sign of cloned carnage Gwen, while the White Widow Gwen has hazel eyes, like the pre cloned one... hope some od the hardcore lore nerds can help me understand lol•ÈÀ"

Why does he need a web shooter if the spider gave him radio-active powers? I've always been confused about that. Maybe all the spider gave him was the ability to climb walls? Just something to think about for those Marvel nerds (no offense.)•ÈÀ
"Carson Doak it is pretty well known fact, that aside generic powers like ‰ÛÏsuper strength‰Û and ‰ÛÏfaster regeneration‰Û, the spider bite gave him ability to stick to things and spider sense. If he were to research on his own powers, he would have developed an ability to discharge electricity( to stun enemies).  Many of his alternative versions have same issues and have to use web shooters. Some don‰Ûªt, though.•ÈÀ"

"1:38Is that Aunt May?•ÈÀ"
"So there's Miles Morales, old Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, Detective Spider Man, Anime Girl Spider Man and Spider Ham? How many Spider Mans are there?!•ÈÀ"
"Jayton S. Multiverse has thousands of versions of heroes and villains, MCU and PS4 Spider men included. We do not know however if these characters are in the same multiverse , or are just merely adaptations, because they are all based of certain characters from comics ( Main Peter Parker, Ultimate Miles Morales, Peni Parker, Peter from Noir universe etc.) yet they are different.•ÈÀ"
+AluTheHungryGhost You're right. Maybe there are even more Spider men and women in the film?•ÈÀ
"Jayton S. Well they might reference some of them. You can clearly see PS4 Spider Man in the background for example( none of other Spider Men wore that suit). However I highly doubt that they will show more Spider related characters. There is a reason why these particular Spider people were chosen : Peter is based on the original Peter Parker( who is in his 30s in comics now), and takes the classic ‰ÛÏmentor‰Û role, teaching new generation of heroes( and being an example to the kids). Miles is there so the kids can associate themselves with someone: he is young, inexperienced, yet brave funny and cool looking - he is the new generation. Then there is Spider Woman( she also goes by the name Ghost Spider) - Gwen, which is again a latest addition to the female spider cast. They could have used any of their Spider Women/Girls, but they used Gwen, because she is young, smart  and  popular now. Girls can look up to her. Then there is Spider Man Noir, who is ‰ÛÏrough and gruff‰Û type of guy. Then there is anime girl- Peni Parker. She actually doesn‰Ûªt behave like that or remotely look like that in the comics, but since anime is hip and cool and cute, they changed her and added for those anime-lovers. Spider- Ham as obviously there as a main joke character.Now when you start thinking who else could be there, then Spider-Man 2099 doesn‰Ûªt make the cut because he is too edgy for the kids movie, all other female spider characters would make Gwen pointless, and having Scarlet Spiders in the movie without proper introduction would be plain stupid.Unless they will show one bad spider-man( there are ones that went rogue ad even became villains) it‰Ûªs unlikely for other spider heroes to appear.•ÈÀ"
"I'd excited but I'm starting to worry that there is going to be too much happening in this movie. We not only have Kingpin and Scorpion as villains but we also have the prowler and then the movie needs to give screen time to Peter, Gwen, Spider-ham, Spider-man noir, and Peni Parker on top of Miles Morales. I really hope this works but I'm worried that sony's ambitions might be a little too big.•ÈÀ"
"galactic85 I think prowler will be in only one fight, while Scorpion and Tombstone will simply be Kingpin‰Ûªs henchmen•ÈÀ"

So spider people from come form their spider Verse into miles ? And why does that villain in the purple look like deadpool ( if you look closely ) ? also what's happening to miles universe? I don't understand what's happening .•ÈÀ
"1. Yes. 2. That's Prowler, depending on universe he is either villain turned hero( sidekick of Spider Man at that), or still a villain. 3. Apparently the collider will destroy it some way or another if they don't stop Fisk.•ÈÀ"

"You know what would make this movie superior?If they bring superior Spiderman in this. Seriously why did they not bring him into this?•ÈÀ"
"Trashi D Namgyal why would they? What would he add? He's obviously not important for the story, so no.•ÈÀ"
@szeax have you read the spider- verse comics? It was him who gathered the other  spidermen to fight the inheritors. And besides his personality would be different from other spidermen. Which would be a breath of fresh air. Hell Kaine isn't even in this.•ÈÀ
"Trashi D Namgyal inheritors aren't in this. And no, his personality is just an angrier and more villainous spiderman.... he's really not that much of a breath of a fresh air.•ÈÀ"
Yeah I know the inheritors aren't in this but they were the main plot of the spider verse. And really? You just saw superior spiderman as a villain?•ÈÀ
"Trashi D Namgyal yes, in the comics, here they aren't even related.And no, I never saw him as a villain.•ÈÀ"

"1. When has anyone ever called this film ground-breaking? Two trailers have come out.2. It's a stylistic choice. The movie deliberately has a lower framerate to emulate the style of a comic book.3. Regardless of its fps, what we've seen so far are amazing pieces of animation and I'm hopeful the whole movie will look like this•ÈÀ"
Janine Murdock are you actually slow?•ÈÀ
"@UniqueNameGuy 1. The article I followed that linked to this trailer initially called it ""groundbreaking"".  2. I know it's a deliberate choice, that doesn't make it good by default.  To me, it's distracting as hell. I had the same issue with Dragon Prince on Netflix. 3. What I've seen looks like a fun story with interesting characters, and so I'll be watching it regardless.  Calling the animation ""amazing"" is a stretch, though.•ÈÀ"
"@szeax Good argument, good argument. You can't see my rebuttal, but imagine a rare bird that just happens to be attached to my hand has flown into the room.  Oh look, there's another one! Wowwwww...•ÈÀ"
"@Janine Murdock The framerate has nothing to do with the animation though, aside from lending itself to the comic book aesthetic, so i would call the animation amazing.•ÈÀ"
"@UniqueNameGuy I think it has a good look.  I like the character design.  But the actual literal definition of animation is using a series of pictures to create the illusion of movement. And , at least to my mind, if that ""movement"" is noticeably jerky to where I think I might almost be back on dial-up and it just isn't buffering properly, that's... not good animation. Whether they did it purposely or no.  Pixar movies look amazing, but I don't need them to drop the framerate to cruddy levels to remind me the romance sci fi between the trash compacting robot and the Apple iRobot 20 is a fiction.They want to try something new, good for them. It's not working for me and I wish they weren't. But, c'est la vie.•ÈÀ"
"@Janine Murdock åÊJanine MurdockåÊ The animation has less frames per second than a normal film might but it is (obviously) still animated. By the definition you just quoted, how do we define good animation? Is it the amount of individual images over a set amount of time? Is it how coherently one image moves into the next? Taken with its literal definition animation can be hard to judge. I guess it all comes down to whether you are a fan of the style•ÈÀ"
Janine Murdock please lay on train tracks•ÈÀ

@Mechs omfg wtf okay I'm done with this shit...I haven't followed a spidey cartoon series since before ultimate came out..... That was an awful series.... As for movies....homecoming was that bad it was worse than spiderman 3•ÈÀ

Miles is interesting if written write but then again so is every character that isn't riri•ÈÀ
"@spider wolf what's the reason people don't like Riri. I actually like her, but then again I've only read the first issue•ÈÀ"

"So I may be stupid, but isn't Peter suppose to only be like two years older than Miles? Yet he looks 26 or so. Yes I know Miles is in another universe and stuff, though there is this animated series where Peter goes to different dimensions. In one of them he meets miles who is sitting in front of Peter Parker's, grave who died in his universe. In the animated series Peter is only a few years older, cause when miles meets him Peter tries to tell him he's not ready or something, in which Miles replies something along the lines of ""Really, your no older than me."" Or something. It's not word for word, but he does hint that Peter is only a few years older cause he was 13. Even in the series Peter from the different universe [time frame] looks to be 15-16. Though when I saw this trailer watching Venom it showed Peter coming from the other universe and miles sitting in front of his Peter's grave. Though in the movie trailer Peter looks older- like adult older. I may be stupid but it's really confusing me, cause the movie reminds me of a part dedicated in the animated series where Peter goes to different universes and Meets, Miles, the girl version of him, a spider-Ham and so on. So the movie reminded me of that. Though again, he looked younger in it, but for some reason he's older here. It's kind of messing with my brain XD  Cause I kind of wished they would have followed that and made Peter a few years older like in the series. Since I was used to it and it seems odd to make him have a stubble and look older. Like Gwen looks normal age, so you'd think Peter would look young like her too. o.O•ÈÀ"
"Skill I believe you are talking about the ‰ÛÏUltimate Spider Man‰Û cartoon events? If yes, that cartoon changed a lot of things from the comics.This animated film is based on 2 comic arcs : Spider-Men and Spider-Verse.The first one is about Peter fromMain universe coming to Ultimate Universe where Miles lives. They get along and defeat Mysterio from both worlds.The second story is about Spider heroes from whole multiverse getting together in order to fight Inheritors - evil family who feeds on their life energies.Now with that in mind, Peter from main universe is currently in his 30s. He was around 28-29 in ‰ÛÏSpider-Men‰Û. Miles now is around 16, I believe? He was 14 back then.•ÈÀ"

"Sergio Cruz people want to see these characters more and more. There are other characters, in fact they are being created every year, but people are not interested in them, preferring the good old ones.•ÈÀ"
"If you read the comics instead of watching the trailers of movies meant to appeal to the highest common denominator and complaining about not seeing new things, you'd know that there are tons of new superheroes with new origins and villains that are really cool. Take the time to do your research before you call out a company for unoriginlity.•ÈÀ"
UniqueNameGuy new superheroes? Where are they? Are you talking about any of the past 3 Spider-Man‰Ûªs? Plus I wouldn‰Ûªt call reading comics ‰ÛÏresearch‰Û.•ÈÀ
@Sergio Cruz Reading the source material is research on the origins of the characters. The new superheroes are in the comics like i said. You can't only watch Sony and MCU films and expect them to throw in some of their least recognisable characters as opposed to hugely iconic characters like Spider-Man. Did you expect the movies to introduce wild new concepts that have never been tried in the comics on an audience of fickle fans (most of whom have never read a comic in their lives) who may or may not react in a negative way resulting in losses for the company? Of course not! They stick with what has been shown to work from the comics. I'd also like to raise a point that only two of the five characters in the trailer got their powers from radioactive spider bites.•ÈÀ

Stan Lee better have a great cameo in this. You feel me?•ÈÀ

Marvel is just copying dc. It just like the flash multi-verse•ÈÀ
"In a way, Spider-Man's role within the Marvel multiverse is very similar to The Flash's role in the DC multiverse, but they're still very different. While speedsters serve as the conduit of the interdimensional Speed Force that surrounds the universes of DC, the Spider-people of Marvel are the avatars of the Cosmic Weaver who governs all the timelines of Marvel.•ÈÀ"
"Eh, multiverses existed in both mediums since 60s. It‰Ûªs not as much copying of idea as it is a natural progression when you have a never ending story that has to be all connected. Having alternative realities gives authors freedom to make up stories that would never make sense in main world.For example, look at MCU. Making it same universe as 616 wouldn‰Ûªt make sense because 1) it would require people to actually read 50 years of comic books. By this alone Disney would scare away 80% of their audience 2) it wouldn‰Ûªt make sense at all. Peter Parker can‰Ûªt be 15 yr old kid now and fan of Tony Stark because he is already in his 30s in main story. Not only that but his character was always independent, especially from Avengers(until he finally joined them). Sam Jackson wouldn‰Ûªt play Nick Fury, because in original story he is white James Bond type war vet.  Same goes with cartoons, games and all other media these companies are represented in.•ÈÀ"
Multiverses have existed before flash or spiderman..•ÈÀ
I want a game with this art style•ÈÀ
did anyone else laugh at the spiderman popsicle?•ÈÀ
What‰Ûªs the backround song?•ÈÀ
I really think that this Peter Parker is Tobey. Not only the references but if you pause at 2:01 Mary Jane really looks like Kirsten Dunst(the actress that played MJ). Peters voice is kinda similar to Tobey as well in this trailer.•ÈÀ
TheBlademaster1337 but he has web shooters•ÈÀ
"@szeax Maybe it is a kind of enhancer. In Spiderman 2 we could see that his powers stopped to work when he became depressed.Maybe old age makes him produce less web and as a backup he creates the web shooters. Or it is physically exhausting to produce organic web so he creates a shooter that let's him save energy for crime fighting?•ÈÀ"
"Good evidence, but y‰Ûªall are kind of over thinking the references at the beginning of the trailer.•ÈÀ"
@TheBlademaster1337 it not toby. There a thing called references you're over thinking it•ÈÀ
looks and sounds nothing like tobey lol. also that doesn‰Ûªt look like kirsten dunst much either lmao. big reach•ÈÀ
@Khalil Big reach.•ÈÀ
"There are alot of similarities to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, but this doesn't look like it's exactly himDefinetly the Toby Spider-Man BUT like a dial to the right or left on the universe clock where everything is slightly different. That's the theory at least•ÈÀ"

"You know, if they made this into a game where you could play as all 6 spider-people, I would happily buy it. Each spider-person already has their own unique style and gameplay ""set up"" for them. Regular Peter Parker could have a bit of slower combat speed because he's slowing down in his later years, but could be a better strategist since he has more experience as Spiderman.Miles could be a bit more inexperienced but doesn't need to react too fast due to his electric shock gloves as his unique gameplay feature.Spider-Gwen, I think you could be the one with the most classic spiderman experience but you could give her a unique feature as well.Noir is pretty self-explanatory. He can be like how he was in Shattered Dimensions and work mainly from the shadows but can also do hand to hand combat if the time calls for it.SP//DR (Peni) would pilot the suit or can be by herself on occasion. With the suit she would probably have the most power and strength out of everone, especially since there's no symbiote suit, but with less durability and agility. Spider-Ham can just have changes in gameplay due to size. Really other than that, it's fun to just become Spider-Ham and beat people._Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
"There is this game called spider man shattered dimensions. It features SpiderMan Noir, Peter Parker, SpiderMan2099, and a Venom encased SpiderMan. I played it a long time ago and I only remember it vaguely, but I that‰Ûªs the only game I can think of with a concept similar to that.•ÈÀ"

"NinjaSpotlights mega lets just ignore the fact that the universes are gonna be destroyed, and she's Japanese fucktard.•ÈÀ"
"I hope it is a more mature spider man movie because of its animation style, it looks like a cartoon, which usually has some bad story and characters.The trailer was pretty nice, the characters seem to be likeable, and no trace of social justice warriors making the characters look bad. The soundtrack was cool, swae lee and post malone did a great job about saving what you love most.The whole aesthetic of the movie looks cartoonish while still making it life-like (no weird shapes or noses). The colors made it a vibrant looking film, NY was looking beatiful at night or day in the movie.I would be looking too see this movie on christmas. Recent spiderman movies were great, homecoming was pretty solid. This movie looks like its aimed to a more younger audience but still can be watched by adults. I just hope that it came out great, marvel is doing such a great job with spider man right now, its a shame if they messed up with this.•ÈÀ"

How many origin stories is spider man going to have? Im over spider man seriously can we invest in the other super heros there are so many more that don't get credit. While this is like the tenth spider man movie and honestly its something I will never watch.•ÈÀ
"King Yellow Wolf it's the 7th, and this is a different story and a different character•ÈÀ"
szeax 7 dosent seem like an excessive amount of films about the same thing? And only 3 of those 7 had the same character. Also 3 of those 7 movies were all origin stories. We don't need another one about spider man I'd like to see something different not another spin off movie that's based on the same thing. Seriously as fans of comics and super hero's I think we owe it to ourselves to criticize this. How many people are we going to make rich because they keep giving us the same thing just copy and paste. I love Spider-Man but am I tired of seeing him be the only super hero that gets a re boot every couple years absolutely.•ÈÀ
King Yellow Wolf none of them were about the same thing... but ok•ÈÀ
szeax Your joking right? 3 movies are all about how peter parkers grandfather gets murdered and he becomes the spider man. Have you seen any of them?•ÈÀ
"King Yellow Wolf you mean uncle, right? And still, only ONE of them focuses on uncle ben, that is the first one.•ÈÀ"
szeax yeah his uncle lol uncle ben. And there's been 3 they all have a different actor as spider man but all tell the same story. And how the hell can Gwen Stacy still be around? And be in school still? And be that young? When peter Parker is old? This makes no sense and just throws all the canon out of the window. Is this really what you want as a spider man fan? I sure as hell don't.•ÈÀ
"King Yellow Wolf all of your questions just mean that you never  actually read canon stories. Marvel has Multiverse, established since 70s. This film adapts various characters from that multiverse.1) The ‰ÛÏOld‰Û Peter is based on main/original( Earth- 616) Peter Parker, yes, the one from ‰ÛÏAmazing Spider-Man‰Û series, that started in 60s and continue to this day.  Main Peter has became Spider Man when he was 15, but as story went, he aged. He is in his 30s currently.2) the black kid is Miles Morales. He is based on Miles Morales from Ultimate Universe. In ‰ÛÏUltimate Spider Man‰Û, Peter was the first Spider Man, but he died at age 16-17 while fighting Green Goblin. Miles took the mantle and continued his legacy.3) Gwen is based on Gwen Stacy from Earth-65. In that world, she was bitten by spider instead of Peter. Peter becomes Lizard and dies. She is a high schooler because  her universe doesn‰Ûªt follow same timeline as main universe.4) dude in black costume is Peter Parker from Noir universe.  In this world he lived during 1930s and became Spider Man because of ancient artifact.5) Spider Ham is comedic character from animal universe. Pretty much everyone there is an animal. He also one of the first alternative universe characters, appearing in 1973.6)  Peni Parker is based on Peni Parker from Earth-14152. While being one of the new additions to the multiverse, she is quite popular. The character doesn‰Ûªt have spider powers, but relies on exosuit. In the film they made her  cute ( as well as her robot) in order to appeal the kids.So if you ask me, a spider man fan, they didn‰Ûªt throw the canon out of the window at all. In fact, they are quite following it.•ÈÀ"

Although her world was inspired by manga and anime, but actually doesn‰Ûªt look like one. They changed her design here.•ÈÀ"

Miles Morales•ÈÀ
"WTF?!why is spiderman black?!!!!!?•ÈÀ"
"pouya ghahremanzade because Miles Morales is black. He was born in black Latino family. He never was white. Why did he become Spider Man? Because he was bitten just like Peter Parker. Does he have same powers? No, he doesn‰Ûªt.Is he ‰ÛÏblack Peter Parker‰Û?No he is not, Peter and him are 2 different people.Why does something like this exist?Because multiverse exists. Multiverse allows authors to explore different situations without ruining main storyline. For example ‰ÛÏ what if Peter Parker lived in 30s and his family was killed by mafia?‰Û Here you go, Spider Man Noir. ‰ÛÏWhat if Peter was not a super genius he is and relied on Tony Stark‰Ûªs guidance and technology?‰Û Here you go, MCU Spider Man:Homecoming. In this case,  it‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏ what if Peter Parker died young, and someone else continued his legacy‰Û.•ÈÀ"

"Ron Z samee, I love spider man movies but because she‰Ûªs all anime like and kawaii, it makes me want to watch it just for her now lol•ÈÀ"
I love this movie trailer•ÈÀ
Who's the anime girl?•ÈÀ
Peni Parker•ÈÀ
I don't think she an anime girl I think that's just an animation but Manga-verse Spiderman is•ÈÀ
The dimensions have different visual rules that carry over when they enter different dimensions so in this movie Peni‰Ûªs universe looks like anime•ÈÀ

JazRo Art I was here from day one.•ÈÀ
"I want this movie to be good. I love Miles, and the plot seems interesting. But the animation just looks so unappealing. Like it was rendered at 12 fps•ÈÀ"
The Not So Funny Show Actually saw an exclusive clip when I went to see Venom and the animation seems fine. And I think it‰Ûªs not 60fps because it‰Ûªs more comic book themed•ÈÀ
"@JazRo Art it can be ""comic book themed"" without looking like a cell phone game from a Nokia. Also, since comic books don't have frames per second, the whole comic book style thing doesn't make sense•ÈÀ"
The Not So Funny Show Bro the animation is beautiful tf you talkin about•ÈÀ
@JazRo Art I'm not talking about the art style. That looks fine. I'm talking about the animation•ÈÀ
"The Not So Funny Show What about the animation? I said it looks beautiful. And the frames aren‰Ûªt bad, I‰Ûªve seen a movie clip from Venom and it looks fine•ÈÀ"
"@JazRo Art ...did you not read what I said before? Your seeing a clip from venom is irrelevant; we all see clips from the movie in the two trailers currently available. The animation is choppy, unappealing, and just plain difficult to watch. It's as if the animation studio tried to make it look like a stop motion movie, but since it's CG animated, it looks like it was made like that to cut corners so they can release it faster.•ÈÀ"
"The Not So Funny Show How is the clip from venom irrelevant, if the clip is literally a clip of Into The Spiderverse? Dude are you stupid?•ÈÀ"
"@JazRo Art if you can't see that a clip from this movie is irrelevant due to the fact we have two different trailers showing clips from the same movie, and you think it is somehow different. Then I'm sorry, but it appears you suffer from an extreme case of stupidity.•ÈÀ"

Even though she is a different timeline, feelings are still feelings and that is the same person...sort of. That would have made for an interesting sub-plot.•ÈÀ"
"Joe S nah. When he met er, it was pretty cool between them. Maybe partially because she s still a schoolgirl, whereas he is already 30 years old dude, for whom Gwen died ages ago.There is howeve, Peter, who went insane because of Gwen‰Ûªs death. He became new Goblin.•ÈÀ"
I'm already in love with the art style•ÈÀ
"they had 55 years worth of stories to choose from, why did they settle on the odious and vile affirmative action poster child ""Miles Morales""?•ÈÀ"

aesthetic gamecube seriously wow where‰Ûªd she even come from though•ÈÀ
"ThatGuy YesThatguy she was introduced several years ago in ‰ÛÏEdge of Spider-Verse‰Û. She is however, quite different in comic books. Her mech is different( looking more like evangelion), and she‰Ûªs rather serious kid( whose parents are dead). They made her an anime airhead for the kids obviously.•ÈÀ"
Phil Lord and Christopher Miller should direct an animation of The Walking Dead with similar visual style like this. But The Walking Dead must feature Clementine from TWD.•ÈÀ
No please no walking dead I want them to make stop motion and 3d and turn it into laggy blood•ÈÀ
So at 1:49 isn‰Ûªt that miles uncle? The one who‰Ûªs the villain that‰Ûªs running across the wall with those special boots at 1:53?The same guy in homecoming when spider was interrogating him?•ÈÀ

Its not a spiderverse movie without spider ham and noir•ÈÀ
Basically the black spider man and a feminist girl and the bad guy is a rich white guy anything wrong with that•ÈÀ

Peni is a loli?•ÈÀ

Peter Parker is the only Spider-Man. Everything else is just a rip off or copy cat because some people can't invent their own superheroes. They have to steal from others.•ÈÀ
Ok? You do know this is a different universe in where peter dies and miles has to take the mantle as Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
"spirittammyk Correction, not steal from others but from themselves.•ÈÀ"
"No, it's just Marvel caving into the SJW's. Instead of making a completely new character with a completely new set of skills, they have to just hijack an already beloved white male character and change them to a female or non white male. It's all it is. And the whole of Spider-Man is that PETER PARKER GETS BIT BY A RADIOACTIVE SPIDER AND HAS HIS DNA ALTERED BECAUSE OF IT. You can't just give someone else the mantle when it was Peter Parker who was bit and no one else. Get it? Just how you can appoint someone else to be Storm or Wolverine or Rogue. Anyone else is just a copy cat to appease to the SJW's who are just too stupid to create their own characters, so have to lash out at white man to do the creative thinking for them. -!-•ÈÀ"
"FN Danmark, I stand by my statement. SJW's used affirmative action to force Marvel to hire them, and they were hired. And when they were at the drawing board, instead of creating a new character, they decided to just take a white male character and change him into a non white character. Same thing they are doing to Iron-Man. The only time I can let this slide is when Steve Rogers gives his mantle over to one of his soldiers (I personally hope in case of the MCU, it is Sam Wilson and not Bucky)  This is why people love Black Panther. He is legit and an original. He's not taking the mantle from someone else.•ÈÀ"

@AluTheHungryGhost yeah that seems about right•ÈÀ

"wildwilie No, Spider-Ham was created back in 1983.•ÈÀ"
"I'm TBH disappointed. The first teaser trailer was so good. It was just Miles learning by himself being Spider-Man (I really like Miles) and then Peter comes at the end of the trailer to show there're so much more other universes (Cuz that's of course what Spider-Verse is about). But now we got Peter as FULL mentor, fucking Spider-Ham, Kawaii-Spider and well Gwen... Are you kidding me? I'm sure it's gonna be a fun movie and I'll enjoy it.

The only thing Sony seems to be doing right is this movie•ÈÀ
why is the animation and frame rate so bad?•ÈÀ
"not bad, it's an artistic style choice to give it a comic book vibe•ÈÀ"
I think the reason why Gwen Stacy looks like her actor Hailee Seinfeld is by being modeled after her.•ÈÀ

You should read the spider verse comic. It's been like that for years•ÈÀ
there's been multiple spider-men since like the 80s/ 90s i think•ÈÀ
"Multiverse with different versions of characters exists since 70s. There are multiple spider characters in main universe since 90s. There were 3 Spider-Women( 3rd one died, and second one became Madame Web), 2 Scarlet Spiders( Ben Reilly was also Spider Man), Silk, Steel Spider, and now there is also Miles Morales( who is stuck in main universe).•ÈÀ"
I don‰Ûªt know if y‰Ûªall noticed this yet but pause at 1:39 and look behind aunt May•ÈÀ

If you guys pause at 1:40 and look to the left of who I believe is Madame Webb you can see the Advaced Suit (the suit in the trailer for the new spider man game) from the new Spider-Man game•ÈÀ
That's Aunt May lol•ÈÀ
ultimate bugidan Well I noticed that her name was never mentioned so I kinda guessed it was Madame Webb•ÈÀ

BushyBrow 64 she's appeared in the comics.•ÈÀ
@szeax Too bad they had to scrap her as the fifth Shattered Dimensions character am I right•ÈÀ
There will never be any casting better than John Mulaney as Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
no spider man 2099? traveling dimensions is his thing!•ÈÀ
it CAN get weirder•ÈÀ
I'm looking forward to this!•ÈÀ
"I got to see the first 35 minutes of the movie at NYCC, and it's a weird feeling knowing just a little more about the movie than basically everyone else here. Gotta tell you though, if you think the animation looks great just judging from this trailer, you're gonna have your minds blown when you see just how good this movie looks.•ÈÀ"
I'm so jealous ahhhh.. Can't wait for December to watch the finished product. The post credits scene they put at the end Venom already looks great!•ÈÀ
"Also, what is the overall vibe of the clip if you don't mind me asking. Is it like more action or more comedy?•ÈÀ"
"Black spider Man, Omegalol•ÈÀ"

"Instead of Spiderman 2099 they go with a obscure anime girl?Seriously?•ÈÀ"
"The Survivor 117 they needed a cute  hip character for the kids obviously. 2099 doesn‰Ûªt make the cut. Actually Peni doesn‰Ûªt make either, hence why they redesigned her and her suit.•ÈÀ"
Dimensional portals and time travel are 2 different things.•ÈÀ
"Lobster Wings Is Sauceless it isn‰Ûªt though. In comic multiverse traveling to another time is just like traveling to another universe. Hence why ‰ÛÏMarvel 2099‰Û had designation Earth-928( for Timestorm Spider Man 2099 it was earth 96099 and for current Spider Man 2099 the number is yet to be established) ,  and MC2 universe had the designation Earth -982. whereas main ‰ÛÏModern Times‰Û universe had designation Earth 616. As it was explained in ‰ÛÏUltimates 2‰Û, different times and possibilities are basically worlds that ride along same thread and get closer to each other if actions of character cause the most likely outcome for that ‰ÛÏfuture‰Û.•ÈÀ"
oh okay•ÈÀ
The Survivor 117 spiderman 2099 may still be in this movie but they just didn't show him in the trailer because they don't want to spoil everything in the movie•ÈÀ
The Survivor 117 plus if you're making a crossover wouldn't make sense to put one of your more obscure characters to help make them more popular?•ÈÀ
Yes and that's a good thing.•ÈÀ
"You bring up 2099, but then call Peni obscure? Yeaaah... You, sir or madam, know nothing about comics and related media. Both characters are equally both beloved AND obscure. I should know...I work in the industry every day. But don‰Ûªt worry...I‰Ûªm sure we will  get our 2099 in some form or another.•ÈÀ"
They should‰Ûªve also had scarlet spider man possibly spider carnage too maybe?•ÈÀ
Miguel sucks•ÈÀ
"@Null and Void ""Slaps!"" Lenguage!•ÈÀ"
"@masamune2984 ""Equally beloved"" 60% things related to her in the comments were people asked who she is. The rest are mostly jokes. She got to comic book issues in Edge of the Spider-Geddon and Edge of the Spider-verse. 2 comics that sold just okay,because there was the title of the event of the front. 2099 is after Miles and Peter the most well known Spider-Man,he has his own comic series,makes in many Spider-man comics appearances and is in every big Spider-man event with Dimensions travel related things. Peni Parker can't even get a good adaptation,because it wouldn't make as much money as if she was in her comics. She is by far not equally beloved if only people know she since 2014 in a one shot....•ÈÀ"
"Spider-Verse literally had about 50 Spider-Men, Spider-Women, Spider-Girls, a Spider-Monkey, a Spider-Pig, and I'm pretty sure there was a Spider-Cat in there as well, fighting a family of dimension hopping Spider Vampires, actually wait a second why did they change it to a collider rather then the whole Spider Vampire thing that would've been beyond epic•ÈÀ"
"She's also incredibly different from the source material, it feels more like a completely new character.•ÈÀ"

"Why is Peter unshaven, has a gut, and acts slow. From the trailer, it seems Miles, and Gwen are better and smarter than Peter. Why?•ÈÀ"
"He's unshaven, because he's stuck in another universe, where his counterpart is dead. How is exactly he's going to shave without money? He doesn't have gut, btw.•ÈÀ"
"He does have a gut. 1:12 and 1:42 mark, gets caught in his own web. But if you're correct, then why isn't Gwen like Peter. She is fine. Plus saw the short at the end of Venom. Peter carried around by Miles and is used as a Joke or comic relief, even made into a snowman•ÈÀ"
"c20995 I barely noticed because in other scenes( and in other trailer) he isn‰Ûªt shown to have any. I guess it‰Ûªs just stylistic choice to show his movement like this. It seems that Gwen has just arrived to this universe at that moment. They also meet Spider Man Noir already at the Spider....hub?Cave? That place with costumes, so do they meet there Spider Ham.•ÈÀ"
@c20995 peter was unconscious because he got zapped by miles' venom blast. well duh he got carried by miles. what do you want him to do? run away from the police in his unconscious state?•ÈÀ

"Depends on universe and medium. Original Peter is in range of 60-80 tons( could be more). He can hold a skyscraper on his shoulders. He also always pulls his punches, because if he didn‰Ûªt , he would rip people‰Ûªs heads off. Ultimate Peter Parker was in 15 Ton range( although he was still young). In movies all Spider Men are nerfed ( just like any superhero there is). Raimi‰Ûªs Peter is probably the weakest , then goes Garfield and Holland.•ÈÀ"

Spider-pig!! Yet again The Simpsons predicting the future. This looks great•ÈÀ
"Spider-Ham existed on the comics since 1983, way before the simpsons made that Spider pig joke.•ÈÀ"
Dude I gotta watch this it's literally the Spider-Verse I hope we see Venom or Carnage here.•ÈÀ

in th emiles morales dimension the original spiderman died.•ÈÀ
What's with the shitty animation?•ÈÀ
Miles isn't Spiderman. He is a SJW'S pathetic attempt to force diversity. Nothing more.•ÈÀ
"Actually, he's spiderman. In his universe peter died, so he now has to take the mantle as spiderman. Plus i don't even know where in the trailer you got the SJW part, but don't ever bring that up again.•ÈÀ"

Not sure if trolling or ignorant of the Spider-Verse. This isn't something new. It's been around for years in the comics.•ÈÀ
The multiverse exists in comic books since 70s. You are not really a fan of Spider Man if you don‰Ûªt know about this.•ÈÀ

Why is nobody talking about rorschach spider-man?•ÈÀ
hes actually one of the most popular spider alternate universes characters. I think they put the most popular spider characters in the movie•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker is not very well known and could have been replaced by Spiderman 2099 or the Scarlet Spider, but I am entirely ok with this (has absolutely nothing to do with my inner weeb) and I understand why they did it as it allows them to draw a character in a drastically different animation style (like how Spider Ham is animated like loony toons and Spiderman Noir is animated like a 80's dectective movie with printer dots making up his color) which is of-course some of the more mainstream anime styles.•ÈÀ"

what about the Ultimate Spiderman (the tv one) or the Scarlet Spider or Spiderman 2099 (arguable the second most popular spider man) or the MCU's or what about that spiderman from the new game.•ÈÀ
"A-DrewG Read my reply above yours.•ÈÀ"
PRONOOBIE I think maybe there will be more but they just didn't show them in the trailer. It would be pretty stupid to spoil everything the movie has to offer•ÈÀ

"Leannan No, they‰Ûªre just not showing them immediately. It‰Ûªs a surprise.And what‰Ûªs a VA? Do you mean VFX?•ÈÀ"
"I'm looking forward to it, but I'm not gonna be completely oblivious to the fact that they could've done more with this movie, it's the same usual 4-5 Spider-Man characters that I've seen countless of times in the animated series or other shows, no Spider-Verse Episode or Movie can top the Original Spider-Verse in the comics, I understand the direction Sony is taking but, I seriously expected to see more Spider-Men than just the casual 4-5 we always get, the plot doesn't seem interesting neither, I expected a much darker turn to the story but most Marvel movies are aimed towards 8 Year Olds or the Casual Audience, so I'm not surprised. I'll watch it but I can't expect much from it. So much potential wasted.•ÈÀ"
its looks too awesome to call it a potential waste even tho its 23 frame per second•ÈÀ
"@PRONOOBIE Yes, you're right, it looks amazing, it takes that comic aesthetic and makes it into animation, which many movies haven't done in a while, but plot wise, I feel like this movie is gonna be a letdown, just my thoughts, I could be wrong.•ÈÀ"
"did u read the comic this movie ""COMIC""•ÈÀ"
"@PRONOOBIE What? Also, I believe you didn't read the comics whatsoever, because the lead up to Spider-Verse was the ""Superior Spider-Man"" Comic Run and the ""Original Sin"" Event. Please rephrase your statement.•ÈÀ"
Sorry this mainstream movie doesn't appeal to your very specific tastes.•ÈÀ
Looks good and I really hope theyll make a spiderman ps4 or simply peter Parker movie with this animarion•ÈÀ
is that sarcasm or ....?•ÈÀ

"A Non-denominational holiday wishes song for 25th December, 2019.It's that time of year, When the snow falls, when the snow falls, when the snow falls.And right across the city,It all looks so clean and pretty.Because from wall to wall the snow falls, the snow falls.And the soft sound padding it makes,And the time of year peace it creates,Makes our hearts appreciate that winter time is the best time,When time seems slow and steady,And as you dream in a nice warm bed cuddled up by your teddy. There's just such a good morning ahead, because as you slept in the night, there will have been  a little present mysteriously magically placed there for you. And all the special day your happiness will shine through.For the present is Spider Man and he looks just like you. Peace for the cold season and you! But no one in the whole wide world should be upset if they don't get what they want, because as long as they've got love and warmth with them on that Special Day, no amount of presents can take such gifts of life away. That's why we celebrate The 25th of December day - So HOORAY! for the wonderful Holiday!  HOORAY, HOORAY, HOORAY.•ÈÀ"

Where's 2099. He's like the most iconic alternate version of spiderman?•ÈÀ
The Fursecutioner 779 he really isn't. He's less popular than noir•ÈÀ
Scarlett...•ÈÀ
"The Fursecutioner 779 I can name like three people who are more known than him. Definitely not the most iconic Spider-Man, but it would have been cool to see him in this movie•ÈÀ"
"The Fursecutioner 779 Miles, Spider Gwen, and Noir are more popular than him currently.•ÈÀ"
Peni Parker is probably the least known one with Spider Noir being extremely popular as-well as Miles and Gwen (people also like Spider Ham just for the memes though)•ÈÀ
"I'd say Miles and Spider-Gwen supplanted him as the most popular alternate versions. If Noir had been more popular than 2099, then Noir would've had a spin-off game dedicated to him, whereas 2099 did. It's probably just harder to tie in 2099 since he's technically not ""alternate"", so much as a possible future.•ÈÀ"
The Fursecutioner 779 I'm thinking maybe he is in the movie along with some other spider men and women but they probably just didn't show him in the trailer because they don't want to spoil everything this movie has to offer•ÈÀ
The Fursecutioner 779 all too true•ÈÀ
"2099 is really cool but D-tier at best, at least compared to the likes of Miles, Gwen, Noir, etc. I enjoy his character though, even if he IS just Batman Beyond wearing a Spider-Man suit: I‰Ûªm sure we‰Ûªll get him in some kind of form, even if just a reference l.•ÈÀ"
B I T C H    L A S  A G N A•ÈÀ
If Spider-man 2099 isn't in the movie then I'll kill Peni Parker or Spider-ham for taken time away where Spider-man 2099 could have been.                                                                                                                     (I'm not saying they are bad characters btw infact Peni Parker is in my top 10 Spider-man /woman list)•ÈÀ
"Scarlet Spidey so why kill them? Why not kill, I don't know, a villain that takes up time?•ÈÀ"
"@szeax Don't take things so literally,I mean I would be disappointed,because he needs to have at least 1 big screen adaptation since he's the 3rd most popular Spidey. It would be also hard to kill a comic book character since they don't really exists.•ÈÀ"
"Scarlet Spidey he's less popular than spider gwen, noir, miles, etc. he isn't the third most popular•ÈÀ"
"@szeax He is after Peter and Miles the most popular. Check his sales they are way above Spider-Gwen and noir, Spider-Gwen exists since 2014 and Spider-man 2099 since 1992,she just gets more represented in cartoons . Noir is also not as popular for the same reasons,I mean he doesn't even gets more represented than him in media. Spider-Gwen could get more popular in the future since she gets her own series and she gets more and more comics that involve her. The only one that comes ""close"" to the popularity of Spider-man 2099 is Ben Reilly,but he has much less comics and it seems Spider-Gwen will take his 4th place when her series comes out, but it will take it's time to beat 2099 in terms of popularity.•ÈÀ"

"Nah, just different, there's been plenty of Peter Parkers.•ÈÀ"
Hes older•ÈÀ
he's about forty.•ÈÀ
As a 30-something person from Queens? With his same adult personality of ‰ÛÏadult Spidey‰Û from the comics? Nah. They absolutely nailed it.•ÈÀ

And then there is whole multiverse of various Peters Parker‰Ûªs. Spider Man Noir is Peter, then there is Peter, that became Hulk, Peter - Goblin, Peter- Captain Universe, Peter that became assasin, Peter that stopped being Spider Man and got family, Peter that retired from being spider man and became a security, Peter that got skin cancer after spider bite, Peter that became cannibal and many others.•ÈÀ"
"@AluTheHungryGhost If I remember correctly the Skin Cancer Peter was not canon the the Marvel comics,it was a different series,with more realistic outcomes,right?•ÈÀ"
"TheDragonKing people use word ‰ÛÏcanon‰Û weird way. It‰Ûªs canon of multiverse just like all alternative universes( like MCU or Spider-Man game) are.

He died, and she had to become next pilot, because the suit is wired to particular DNA.•ÈÀ"
Supaidaman aka Japanese Spiderman drove a mech called Leopardon. It even got a cameo in the comics.•ÈÀ
"The original design for Peni Parker IS an Evangelion homage, down to the mech she pilots. The movie distances itself from those references to better suit the variety of the cast. Look up Sp//Dr. Also, if that wasn't apparent enough, in the first panels of her universe, they drew in Shinji, Asuka, and Rei as her classmates in the background.•ÈÀ"

@SD Brand yeah but good trailers can create hype and yet leave the mystery of the story for the movie•ÈÀ
Tidely Pom so what's the plot?•ÈÀ
"@szeax let's see if I can create a general outline. In the universe of miles, he's just gone through the process of being bitten and uncovering his powers. somewhere down the line, miles path intertwines with kingpins plans involving a collider that opens up a gateway to different universes unwillingly drawing in all the spiders from the different universes that happened to be in the exact same locations. After that, somewhere between Parker mentoring miles and mile's dad disliking spider Man, we get to know that the gateway is still functioning in a way that it's causing their universe to rip apart. This may be similar to the concept of phase shifting in ant man and the wasp. I'm lrobably wrong here tho. All the spiders need to come together to try and fix the situation and defeat the boss( maybe kingpin) and return to their universe. Off course, in between the plots going to take us through humourous situations like a typical spiderman comicbook arc and character development of his dad and mile's himself. Now we have to wait for other trailers to fill in missing details like are there more villains and stuff.•ÈÀ"

"No. World of Warcraft animated shorts, like ""Harbingers"" and ""warbringers"" are done in comic book style (with lots of barely moving still images). This is very-low FPS. It looks too much like clay-mation or stop-motion. It's interesting... but quite annoying for an action-genre.•ÈÀ"

"Tony Wright Peni Parker is from Earth-14512. At the age of 9, her father was killed in the Sp//dr suit, a mech piloted by a genetically altered human and a radioactive spider. Peni took the responsibility of piloting the suit after her father's death, and allowed herself to be bitten by the spider. This is all inspired by Evangelion, and even shows a cameo. In the comics, she is recruited into the Spider-Army by Old Man Spider-Man and Spider-Ham. She is an interesting Eastern take on the Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"

Why is the FPS so low•ÈÀ
"The animation is _ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´. This looks like it‰Ûªs going to be a good film. First the video game for PS4, now this! Spider-Man is killing it in the superhero market & that is awesome. _ÙÔ_ÙÔ_Ù÷__ÙªÎ_ÙªÎ•ÈÀ"
Miles coming either the 1s and bomber jacket _ÙÕø‰Û_•ü•ÈÀ
Anyone else here after seeing venom?•ÈÀ
Is I am the only one who think that at some point the Frame per second is too low.....?_Ù÷_ 0:01•ÈÀ
That's intentional. It makes it feel a little more like a comic I guess•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm not sure what you said there bud.•ÈÀ
@SeÌ±or Chiefton he thinks the fps is to low for this animation•ÈÀ
"I'd say the low frame rate is intentional, like the animation if flipping through the pages of a comic book.•ÈÀ"
Its a deliberate artistical choice•ÈÀ
@Tommy Burney then why don't we read comic book rather than watching whole movie _Ù÷Ü_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
@AKSHAR REACTS Because its a way to get newer generations into spiderman.•ÈÀ

Jack M I see I‰Ûªve triggered you. Maybe you should take your own advice and stop crying. Muppet getting all worked up over a little kids cartoon _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
@Paynan Diaz that person is right. You should read some comics of the spider verse.•ÈÀ
"Paynan Diaz if your calling a movie something bad but you don't understand it, you shouldn't call it bad•ÈÀ"
@Paynan Diaz seriously your acting like a kid. if you have no idea about any of this doesn't mean you should write useless stuff like this•ÈÀ
Mechs it amazes me how many of you donkeys are calling me a child yet none of you know how to use ‰Û÷your‰Ûª or ‰Û÷you‰Ûªre‰Ûª. Keep watching you kids cartoons and trying to tell other people to be grown up _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
"@Paynan Diaz that doesn't change the fact that you are a 9 year old Emoji using kid. Also ''Keep watching you kids cartoons'' isn't right, so you also can't write normally.•ÈÀ"

Racism is thinking one race is superior to the other this movie is just about Spider-Man from different dimensions teaming up and one of them happens to be black i don't see how that's racism and Miles Morales has been around for years before this SJW propoganda stuff or whatever you call it started getting more recognition.•ÈÀ

"cool, probably cool. The cinema industry is now increasingly feeling the underworld with its feet. Since not able to offer something new and cult for decades. Are you giants or losers? Release the video already in 360. Start small.

"The actual truth is that this is made by Sony and not Marvel Studios. They are allowed to do anything with Spider Man( in movies/cartoons) and not use Tom Holland. Lore wise, MCU is just one universe and not even a main one.

"I like how kooky this is, but why is the animation so choppy? If they are trying to emulate claymation I don't know if they're doing a decent job, since I've seen stop motion animation with smoother, more natural feeling movement. I mean, it still not as jarring as CGI Venom's movement, but that's not much of a compliment. Kinda wish this was a high budget 2d animated movie with some crazy good studio behind it, like Madhouse.•ÈÀ"
It's so it looks like each frame could be in a comic book•ÈÀ
"Thanks for the info. I don't think I like it, but it's good to know that at least it's a conscious artistic decision rather than cutting corners out of necessity. I might still go see it in theathers, perhaps it will grow on me as I watch it on the big screen.•ÈÀ"

I want each alternate  Spider-Man to have meaning to me yes even Spider-Ham Cause they are heros in there own respectful dimension so I wanna see how they all can team up. But where is Spider-Man 2099? Where is the alternate universe were Black Suit Spider-Man is the ACTUAL good guy....I mean Dr.Strange knows em all right? But O guess theres a budget for everything....THANK GOD Comic Books aren't restricted to this....but still Even BIG SCREEN animation I'll hop my butt in the seat no matter the age and see my favorite  Superheroes do anything at this point as long as it's done right which I think this movie has it locked. I mean it's an animated movie and before Deadpool gets on it the internet knows... and half the time doesn't know all. I'm gonna give this movie a shot Sony animation do your thing and give us something to like in animation form.•ÈÀ

This movie has so much potential of being good. This movie can make SONY redeem themselves. When the first 2 Into the Spider-Verse trailers came out, they were beautiful, stylish and, they captured the beautiful scenery and visual style of the comics and the animation was gorgeous, plusC it could be in ways like Black Panther since the superhero is biracial. And kids will look up to Miles. But, seeing the after credits scene of Venom with this, right after the sneak peek of this showed, everyone was so disappointed because the clip was so childish and stupid...and I really hope this movie doesn‰Ûªt suck.•ÈÀ"

"The movie itself looks fun to watch.  However, why is Hollywood trying to make every character either black or female ?  There‰Ûªs talk about a black James Bond, a black Superman.  We now have the female Ghost Busters and the female Terminator.  Instead of creating original characters or promoting those that are already black and/or female, Hollywood is just changing famous, fictional personas.  If you want REAL racial/gender equality just create something unique instead of stealing and altering the work of others.•ÈÀ"
"H G I‰Ûªm surprised you haven‰Ûªt come across the thousands of comments that say this but it isn‰Ûªt a black Spider-Man, Miles is from the comics well before all this modern day crap•ÈÀ"
"Miles Morales was created in 2011, perhaps as a response to the Donald GLover for Spider-man campaign•ÈÀ"
"This has been going on for a while.  It‰Ûªs not recent at all.  We can talk about DC and how they changed the sexual orientation, gender and skin color of quite a few characters.•ÈÀ"
"Also, add the fact that Peter Parker is the original Spider-Man and then a knockoff was created to seem more inclusive.  I rather have Marvel, along with D.C, to promote characters that were originally black, female or have ‰ÛÏnon-normative‰Û sexual orientation.•ÈÀ"
"Weird that you‰Ûªre willing to accept a Spider-Man that is also a literal pig no questions asked, but a black Spider-Man is just a bridge too far.•ÈÀ"
d3lvn At least he isn‰Ûªt a knockoff.  All I‰Ûªm saying is that it‰Ûªs tiring to see characters changed just to conform to a P.C culture.•ÈÀ
"‰ÛÏAt least he isn‰Ûªt a knock-off‰Ûlol what? They‰Ûªre both derivatives of the same character! The pig is no more or less a knock-off than Miles is. I‰Ûªm just saying it‰Ûªs strange that you don‰Ûªt think Spider-Ham infringes upon the integrity of Spider-Man, but the black guy does. Deeply strange set of priorities you got there.•ÈÀ"
"d3lvn When a version of a character has been completely altered there is an issue.  Of course I, like most others, have a problem with a black version of Spider-Man.  Imagine if Hollywood decided to make a white or Mexican version of Black Panther.  It‰Ûªs not just color I have a problem with but rather any radical changes to a character wether it be appearance or mannerisms.  Especially when it‰Ûªs to conform to PC culture.•ÈÀ"
"@H G ""When a version of a character has been completely altered there is an issue.""""It‰Ûªs not just color I have a problem with but rather any radical changes to a character wether it be appearance or mannerisms.""Oh, you mean like Spider-Ham?•ÈÀ"
d3lvn Spider-Ham ?  You do know most people don‰Ûªt even know who that is right ?•ÈÀ
H G I highly doubt most people watching this video don‰Ûªt have at least a vague sense of who that is considering he‰Ûªs in the trailer.•ÈÀ
d3lvn ...or people just learned about him due to watching the trailer.•ÈÀ
"Black Panther is an AFRICAN king, Spider-man is a poor kid from New York, there's a difference,and besides most kids in New York from low income families aren't white these days, it just reflects the existing realities. In any case there's no reason to be whining about it.•ÈÀ"
"Ty K. Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is a poor WHITE kid from NY.  People get pissed off of a ‰ÛÏcolored‰Û character was ‰ÛÏwhite-washed‰Û.  So why is ‰ÛÏblack-washing‰Û O.K !  Using your logic, Cyborg from D.C was created by his father who is a scientist.  The majority are white, Asian or Jewish.  So, maybe Cyborg shouldn‰Ûªt be black to reflect reality.  Now it‰Ûªs funny how my comment to skin color is what bothered you but not my comment about sexual orientation or gender.  All I‰Ûªm saying is that Hollywood ‰ÛÏIN GENERAL‰Û has been making drastic changes to successful characters to comply with the P.C narrative.  Instead they should use characters that are originally Black, gay, women or whatever.•ÈÀ"
"Except Miles is separate character created in the 21st century, he's not Peter anyways. Having someone else take up the mantle of a hero isn't something new.  If Sony is going to milk this franchise they are going to include the other characters, especially ones that have proven to be POPULAR. I don't think changing a characters ethnicity is something they ought to do in general, but it is not something I'm going to cry over either. To answer your question, White characters are usually characterized mostly by their personality, not the fact that their white, while for POC characters their status as a minority or their heritage is far more likely to play a significant role in their story, so whitewashing messes up the character itself. Additionally whitewashing reduces the already limited number of roles given to POC actors while there are still countless acting roles for white people.•ÈÀ"
"Ty K. Dude, you just stated that the characters‰Ûª ethnicity plays a big role as a minority.  That‰Ûªs the problem right there.  It‰Ûªs less about the character and more about their skin color.  You also just stated that it‰Ûªs to help POCs get more roles.  PC culture is getting out of control.  This is not the only movie or character I mentioned BTW.  However, you, like a lot of other people, only care about the characters‰Ûª appearance.  Since ‰ÛÏWhite characters are usually characterized by their personality,‰Û then we should have more white characters at this point.  I care more about the content but it‰Ûªs being sacrificed for the superficial and to push an agenda.•ÈÀ"
"Its less about pushing diversity and more about trying to adapt to a more diverse market. Comics are less exclusively a white teen thing these days so they're trying to draw in more, newer groups of readers. Its not about the politics, its about the money.•ÈÀ"
"JLT0087 That‰Ûªs not 100% true.  There have been video games, comics and movies that did terribly even though they were promoting ‰ÛÏdiversity‰Û.  Also, comic businesses that were pushing a Liberal agenda had to shut down.  Now some businesses are trying to reach a more diverse group but in turn are sacrificing quality.  Their mentality is ‰ÛÏIf we just have a diverse cast the money will flow.  Screw putting actual effort into our media.‰Û  Not only that, one doesn‰Ûªt have to be the same ethnicity or gender as a character/person to relate or idolize them.  There are many people of color, both male and female, who idolize Marilyn Monroe.  Frank Sinatra has had his songs covered by many people who were not physically like him.  Batman and Superman are adored by White and non-White people in And out of the U.S.  It‰Ûªs all about content not physicality.•ÈÀ"
"@H G It's a bit of an oversimplification, true, but entertainment is still a buisness and will always be guided by money. You're right to say that a lot of them are treating diversity as a quick fix, and not following it up with actual effort.•ÈÀ"
"How does the way white characters are written necessitate more white characters? What makes you think I'm only interested in their appearance just because I defend the creative decisions of one children's movie? This movie is more about Sony milking their IP for all its worth, THAT is their agenda, you'll still get plenty of movies about Peter. You really like to jump to weird conclusions to fit YOUR agenda, stick to watching Rebel videos and don't watch this if it bothers you that much. You complain about ""pc culture"" but are part of a culture that plays the exact same whiny games about things that don't really affect you.•ÈÀ"
"Ty K. Again, I stated this movie and media in general.  Again, I stated that there are businesses pushing this agenda.  Again, I stated that the quality of entertainment is being sacrificed to fit this PC culture to push an agenda or make money.  If getting good quality entertainment means making all characters white, since you stated that white characters have more developed personalities then, so be it.  The fact that you care more about skin color than actual character development says more about you than anything.  Now, this character seems endearing.  However, I my argument is that original characters are being radically changed to fit a narrative or they are being replaced by someone/something more PC.  I‰Ûªm talking about, not just skin color, but also gender, religion and sexual orientation.•ÈÀ"
"sigh Again, where did I state skin color matters more than character development? I didn't know the two things are mutually exclusive. I didn't say white characters had more developed personalities, the personality just gets more focus for white characters, that alone doesn't make them better or worse or developed per se. Sony approached Miller and Lord about doing an animated film and they picked  in Miles as their main character as Peter had already been done many times. You rant about things that have next to nothing to do with this film. I don't suppose you can provide examples with where there is concrete proof that ""pc culture"" actually sacrificed the quality.•ÈÀ"

He looks more like his 90s design only a little disneyfied.•ÈÀ

Giovanna Papa those are just references. If you payed close attention this Peter uses web shooters. Tobey‰Ûªs Peter had naturally produced web.•ÈÀ
"@Ben Shaporange Using them as references/homages of the Raimi trilogy, not exactly to be proof that he's THE Spidey from that trilogy.For how overkill the one where he punches the car looks, it maybe a made-up story he tells Miles.•ÈÀ"

u don't get what I'm saying. yes those character exist. but how many movies are about them? basically none. big media outlet are run by conservative old men who likes their man character white. it's only recently that they feature colored character. because sjw has been whining and crying. and when the feminist do too. we'll see a female spiderman.•ÈÀ

Who's that little japanese girl•ÈÀ
"She's Peni Parker, she originates from a comic that was meant to be a more ""Japanese"" styled story, so it ended up being a bit of a parody of Evangelion. Basically she doesn't have Spider powers but she uses that giant robot called SP//dr which can do what a spider does, also her father died using it or something? But that's basically all you need to know!•ÈÀ"

"it takes the effort on your part, cause you have to ask Jesus to save you simple as that•ÈÀ"
"@Gene rees Anyone can ask for the Lord to come into their heart, I'm not denying that. But the Lord expects people to act humble before not just him, but everyone they meet and to follow his laws that he set before us all. I'm not putting you down, I'm glad you're spreading His word, but It takes a bit more effort than asking the Lord into their heart and asking for forgiveness for past sins. To each his own, I guess. I read the Complete Jewish version with a New International reference printed with it.•ÈÀ"

The only thing i hate from him is now he looks like a jerk•ÈÀ
But what about the death of peter in miles universe. That would happen then the 16 year old? peter parker we used to know visits the universe as he is chasing goblin. Right?•ÈÀ
@IFI PLAY he's not a jerk  but a bit of a slob which he kind of is in the  spiderman trilogy and comics.•ÈÀ
He looks so...careless...•ÈÀ
"Idk the timeline of these spiderverse is weird, in some games and cartoons like Ultimate Spider-Man Peter is still in teenage years while Miles is fighting ultimate goblin•ÈÀ"

"I mean, He's the lead of this movie, so...•ÈÀ"
"@Codysir so that means he's the lead, I get it. The real proof of that comes from the merchandise sales after the opening. If Gwen Stacey sells more toys, miles is out.•ÈÀ"
Lee Haynesworth spiderham will probably sell the most toys•ÈÀ
Boy I can't wait to not see this!•ÈÀ
Why?•ÈÀ

2:15 how is peni hanging on the wall? she doesn't have any Spider power other than controlling her suit.•ÈÀ

"No idea where you got the SJW part, but ok.•ÈÀ"
"Haha, it was an ""if"", you can't say that there's no cause for concern.  Look at Star Trek, Doctor Who, Star Wars, Mass Effect, lots of Marvel, Ringling Bros, every MMORPG, ""microaggressions"" destroying the work industry, yeah... lots of cause for concern.But this looks good.•ÈÀ"

Of all the black focused movies this year that are trash The Black KKKlansman and this movie I can easily tell will be the best when it comes to ending racism. The other movies made this year are just focused on how good blacks are as if that won‰Ûªt spark controversy and arguments. This movie looks lovely I‰Ûªll definitely be watching this! I really like the new comic style for an animation movie_ÙÔ_ÙÔ•ÈÀ

"We thought from the beginning that the everyday life of spider-man is fighting crime and saving his hometown of New York while other big heroes go on a big adventures.1. Avengers save earth and sometimes the galaxy.2. Guardians of the Galaxy save the galaxy.3. Fantastic Four save earth and explore the N-Zone.4. X-men save the world and deal with the mutant racism from human.But with the introduction from the first cartoon (Spider Wars Part 1: I Really, Really Hate Clones) featuring other universes of spider-men known as the spider-verse to video games (Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions) and comic books and now this movie, this spider life is never going the same any more.That is why spider-man is still the best super hero ever.Plus Peni Parker is cute and her mech SP//dr is awesome.•ÈÀ"

Don‰Ûªt know about movie but Music is Awesome!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
I thought this is a live action film for the next Spiderman sequal for the MCU; Why are they making an animated movie of Spiderman when we already have a live action film? And what are the directors and producers think it's okay to change Peter Parkers character. Spiderman it's not the same as the original anymore. What are they doing?•ÈÀ
What's wrong with using a different Spider Man?•ÈÀ
"1) this Peter Parker is actually more close to original one than MCU is. 2) There are quite many Spider-themed heroes besides Peter Parker. Ben Reilly and Kaine are Scarlet Spiders. Then there is Silk, Arachne and 3 Spider Women. Miles Morales( main character here) is just one of many Spider Men from parallel worlds. 3) why not?  It‰Ûªs just one of many alternative worlds stories. You are not complaining about MCU being alternative to the original story, do you?•ÈÀ"
"Lillian Tran, this movie, Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse is made by Sony, not Marvel Entertainment, because Sony owns the film rights to spider-man, they lent the character to Marvel to use in their MCU, while Sony works on other titles that are completely unrelated to said MCU, such as Venom and this animated movie, so there's no point looking at marvel and asking them why they're doing this because they have nothing to do with it at all•ÈÀ"
"For starters, this movie is made entirely by Sony, not alongside Marvel Studios.•ÈÀ"
I have a feeling that this is going to be awesome!•ÈÀ

OH MY GOD GUYS A BLACK SPIDERMAN HOW PROGRESSIVERLY PRETENTIOUS AND NOT DOWN RIGHT TRY HARD RETARDED HAHAHAHAHAHA•ÈÀ
your comment is soooo much more try hard then this tbh•ÈÀ
"Okay there's so much wrong with this comment that I don't even know where to begin. But I guess I'll start with the fact that ""pretentious"" refers to something that is trying too hard to seem deeper or more impactful then it is, which gives both sides of your conjunction the exact same meaning. So this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. You basically said ""A black Spider-Man, how try hard and not down right try hard"".  Second, Miles Morales has been a character in Marvel canon for years. Third, typing something in all caps is annoying and does not make your point seem any stronger. Fourth, you spelled ""progressively"" wrong.  But other then that this comment was great. 10/10 for effort.•ÈÀ"

thats the point for a comic bookish style of animation•ÈÀ
"dat boi So the point is to look like it's run on a Windows 95 and look bad? Where do clowns like you come from?Commander Rex328 No,  the point for a ""comic bookish style of animation"" isn't a poor framerate. There's plenty of media (including movies, tv shows, and video games) that have ""comic bookish style of animation"" and have a framerate that doesn't look like chopping lettuce.•ÈÀ"

That anime girl just killed it for me anybody else?•ÈÀ
"Nope. By the way, her name is peni parker.•ÈÀ"
"An anime character is what killed it for you and not the Spider-Man who's a talking cartoon pig? Don't get me wrong, I love Spider-Ham, but I don't get a lot of people's seemingly impossible ability to accept anime, no matter the context. I get that anime isn't for everyone, but up against a talking cartoon pig, a Japanese-female Spider-Man who's animated in anime-style isn't anywhere near as insane or out of place.•ÈÀ"
she's my fav actually.•ÈÀ
"Nah, just the fact rule34s gonna be on the hunt more than ever.•ÈÀ"

When are they going to do a Chinese Spider-Man or maybe Indian or Philippino. Or is it only blacks that feel the need to cultural appropriate everything a white man does? Fk sony and fk Hollywood. Nobody is asking the NBA to have more white basketball players. And sure as fk nobody is asking any other culture on this planet accept white culture to be more ‰ÛÏdiverse‰Û. You want to stop racism stop taking about it and stop feeling guilty  about contrived leftist narratives. Give me movies that don‰Ûªt have stupid SJW or just die Hollywood.•ÈÀ
Need a tamp?•ÈÀ
"@I'm dat Guy yeah, that person needs one very badly.•ÈÀ"
"Ace FreelyOmg this is a good quality EDGY complaint•ÈÀ"
"There is an Indian Spider-Man (Pavitr Prabhakar) since 2005 in the comics. Miles in contrast is only around since 2011. Not that this matters to you... there is a literal talking cartoon pig Spider-Man (Peter Porker, around since 1983) in this movie, but you chose to be offended by the black kid.•ÈÀ"
"Film literally features a black, white Asian and pig spider man but the black one is the one that offends you? You are a joke.•ÈÀ"
I'm dat Guy - weak. You have nothing to argue so attack my manhood. Well Nancy it‰Ûªs very much in tact. Funny thing about you lefties. You never know who ur talking to. Stupidity is common place. Stop playing video games and watching basketball and read a history book. Then come back and we can have a chat.•ÈÀ
MrAmazing79 truth has a tendency to get in your face. Embrace it.•ÈÀ
MrLondonuts I‰Ûªm not offended at all. I‰Ûªm not racist like minorities are. Im just sick of all the PC culture that at its core says that anything a white man does is racist so minority groups need to do it over with another culture. It‰Ûªs actually quite pathetic.•ÈÀ
"Ace Freely well as I said, I find it slightly confusing and also a bit hilarious that in the film that features multiple different spider people from different dimensions, that are different races, genders, ages and even species, You only have a problem with the black one.•ÈÀ"
"Ace Freely Ok, firstly ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm not racist like minorities are‰Û that‰Ûªs racist. Secondly, what you said about your dislike towards PC culture, ok sure, you don‰Ûªt like that but this film isn‰Ûªt that. If they turned peter Parker black that would be unacceptable, but miles is not a black peter Parker, he is an iteration of Spider-Man that also happens to be black, the same way Gwen isn‰Ûªt a girl peter Parker but a different character and an iteration of Spider-Man, peni Parker, is not an Asian female peter Parker but a different character who is an iteration of Spider-Man. The only character we‰Ûªve seen in this movie that fits the pc culture you dislike is peter porker aka spider ham, he is literally designed to be the animal version of peter Parker. So if you want to be angry at anything be angry at the pig._Ùá•ÈÀ"

"AnimeFreak Not anime, but the closest thing you‰Ûªll get•ÈÀ"
"Well, we already have the Japanese official version of Spiderman. Go check Spiderman manga and Supaidaman.•ÈÀ"
"The funny thing is, if it weren't for Japanese Spiderman, Power Rangers and Super Sentai might not exist today. At least not in the way we know them.•ÈÀ"
"Dubu Worshipper She is anime. She's the epitome of an anime archetype, her entire thing is obviously to mean that she's the ""anime one"", in the same way that Spider-Ham is ""the cartoon one"". In this movie at least. Not so much in the original comics, but even in those her concept was heavily inspired by anime tropes, even if she didn't look anime by design.•ÈÀ"
"James G it‰Ûªs NOT anime, but merely INSPIRED by it. smh•ÈÀ"
"Dubu Worshipper ""Anime"" is also an adjective. Something can be ""anime"" without literally being a Japanese made animation, in the same way that something can be ""cartoony"" without literally being a cartoon.•ÈÀ"
"-There is a Mangaverse Spiderman who is part of a spider ninja clan very Shonen Inspired-Peni Parker is also inspired Anime/Manga but Seinen series like ""Evangelion"" and ""Akira"" Peni's introduction in Edge of Spider verse included characters that look an awful lot like Rei, Asuka, Shinji & Kaneda,•ÈÀ"
"James G i get that, but the fact that the creator of the character of Peni, who was only influenced by manga, would not call his creation ‰ÛÏanime/manga‰Û remains. they did stylize Peni in this film to be anime-inspired. but i‰Ûªm also talking about the original design/concept/comic.•ÈÀ"
"If you want an anime Spider-Man, check out the ‰ÛÏMangaverse‰Û line.•ÈÀ"
Adrian The Vulture but Super Sentai aired before the japanese Spider-Man show aired....•ÈÀ
AnimeFreak stfu weeaboo•ÈÀ
"Dubu Worshipper Yes, but people are talking about her variation in this movie, not the original comic concept so you're point is kinda a moot one don't you think? You acted like people were wrong for calling this version of Peni anime because the original comic Peni isn't fully anime (which is debatable. She doesn't look anime but her concept and storyline is very heavy in anime tropes). That doesn't make sense.•ÈÀ"
"James G So if something has anime tropes and is animated, you call it anime. i see you‰Ûªre the same type of person who thinks Big Hero 6 and TLA are anime. they‰Ûªre INSPIRED but they‰Ûªre not anime. ask someone who creates manga/anime for a living, oh wait, they‰Ûªre all in Japan.•ÈÀ"
"Dubu Worshipper Anime is a adjective like I said. Frickin' hell, mate, get your stick outta your backside.•ÈÀ"
James G please give me more examples of what you consider ‰ÛÏanime‰Û. please. I would appreciate it.•ÈÀ
"Dubu Worshipper Jeez Louis. Look, Peni Parker is made to be the ""anime spider-man"" in this movie. That's the bottom line. Anime is a adjective, like ""cartoony"". Seriously, get outta here. To quote you ""I bet you're one of those people who"" gets triggered when someone uses the term ""Japanese anime"" because you think that anime is strictly from Japan.  ""Anime"" can refer to an animation style. To quote wikipedia:""Outside Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.""Peni Parker is anime in this movie. Why is this so hard to get. Jeez, I feel like I'm trying to teach long-division to a 3 year old...•ÈÀ"
James G oh yea•ÈÀ
James G thank you. I was 18 months when i learned long division.•ÈÀ
Ugh the weaboos are already here...•ÈÀ
‰ÛÜ@HAZZARD Yes because everyone who recognizes or even likes anime is suddenly a weeaboo•ÈÀ
Anime and cartoons literally means the same thing...•ÈÀ
"‰ÛÜ@Warilized In Japanese, cartoon is referred to as Anime (Anim€Òshon), and are classified interchangeably.Outside of Japan, most people (including localization companies like Funimation and Viz Media) refer to Japanese animation as Anime for simple/implicit reason. Some may get upset by one saying ""anime"", but my point is that what he says is totally understandable. Would you rather him say ""moe Japanese animation""? What else would he refer it as? ""They have a cartoon spider man""?•ÈÀ"
"For your information, I am 50 percent the asian so yaaaaaaaaaaa•ÈÀ"

Tom Holland‰Ûªs Spider-Man should be at the very end to tell everyone about the new Marvel‰Ûªs Spider Man movie. Like an end credits scene.•ÈÀ
Man I love the animation design in this movie!!•ÈÀ
The cop looks like the guy from Cloudy with A chance of Meatballs•ÈÀ
"Ma man thats what i was thinking, his kid has grown up•ÈÀ"
"Same directors tooToo bad he dies in the comics lol•ÈÀ"
You deserve the death•ÈÀ
Racisttttttt•ÈÀ
LOCK WOOOOOOOD•ÈÀ
@deejaycoral8 ig you haven't read the comments because you got salty over a comment that's true he does in the comics•ÈÀ
Quinn V. Actually the directors of cloudy with a chance of meatballs produce this movie•ÈÀ
"The directors are the director of Rise of the Guardians, writer of 22 Jump Street, and writer of The Little Prince•ÈÀ"
"It could be, they like to reference to their other movies•ÈÀ"
I know right•ÈÀ
"COINCIDENCE, I THINK NOT•ÈÀ"
"@10,000 subscribers with one video also in the new game...they are the same person, right?•ÈÀ"
His was a thing before than and his named Davis•ÈÀ
Quinn V. Spoiler alert•ÈÀ
"I think you guys gave me a heart attack, i'm so excited for this!!!!•ÈÀ"

Mr. Stark would be glad  now•ÈÀ
"Of all the alternate universe spider-mans, why did they add the goofy pig and anime girl?But ill let it slide because of 1:35•ÈÀ"
"Is the Peter Parker in this supposed to be the one from the Sam Raimi universe? They do give some pretty blatant hints•ÈÀ"
Thank you...•ÈÀ
This looks sexy af•ÈÀ
SPIDER HAM!!!!!!•ÈÀ
"Why is it that anything white people have has the be shared, taken away, diversitied up the yin yang? You don't see other people forced to share their icons or lose all their heros.  Should Malcolm X be rewritten as a white guy? Mohammed Ali? He's white now. Black Panther is a white guy.Make a NEW character if you want a black person in it. Be creative. Stop taking away other people's heros.•ÈÀ"
Yeah like miles isnt a new character dang you guys are never satisfied he didnt even replace Peter last time i checked peter is still the main spidey in the comics Miles was just the second spidey in is alternate universe when peter died in the alternate universe and with some marvel universe merging bullshit their universe merged Ps: black panther has a adoptif white brother white wolf happy now.•ÈÀ
Idiot•ÈÀ
0:11 is this confirmed future Tobey spidey?•ÈÀ
I need noir yes my fav•ÈÀ
1:14 is spider man selling out nike shoes!!_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
This is stupid. It takes the uniqueness of a super hero. Whats the point if theres a million others like him•ÈÀ
"Same idea, different takes. I mean, there's a dozen Hulks, multiple Wolverines, a couple different Captain Americas, and several Iron Men wearers. They all have the same basic concept to them, but vastly different executions between them.Of course, you're not exactly wrong, as there are HUNDREDS of different Spider-Men out there, which is more than most heroes.•ÈÀ"
"If spider man can be black, can we have a white black panther next since marvel is so racially inclusive?•ÈÀ"
looks amazing•ÈÀ
ŠÈÛŠ_ö¾Ñ¦ŒÛªŠü_¾÷Ê•ÈÀ

Whats the song that plays in this trailer?•ÈÀ
But where‰Ûªs Tom Holland•ÈÀ
He's a bit dusty at the moment.•ÈÀ
does anybody know the name of the song used in this trailer?•ÈÀ
The animation is like stop-motion mixed with computer animation.•ÈÀ
It's 3d animation with choppier framerate to look like stop motion animation•ÈÀ
"Honestly, stop motion is way smoother than this. looks at LAIKA•ÈÀ"
I really like it•ÈÀ
And motion capture like ready player one•ÈÀ
"I love that the art styles match with their respective Spider-Man:1. Peter and Miles = Traditional comic style2. Spider-Gwen = Neon colors like in an 80's music video3. Noir = Noir... Duh4. Penny Parker = Anime5. Spider-Ham = Cartoons•ÈÀ"
Mr. XD Specifically Spider-Ham looks like he‰Ûªs from the rubber-hose era of cartoons•ÈÀ
"Sooo truee, love the anime one :3•ÈÀ"
Peni Parker wasn‰Ûªt stylized as a manga/anime•ÈÀ
"@Dubu Worshipper She's basically a Mecha anime protagonist. As I've seen in the comic images (haven't read it), she looks diferent but, she is still have that manga style but a more 90's kind of style.•ÈÀ"
"lol that‰Ûªs literally Gerard Way‰Ûªs style. he‰Ûªs been drawing that way for decades. i get that it looks inspired by it, but i wouldn‰Ûªt quite call it that.•ÈÀ"
I know right it's super cool•ÈÀ
"except, I don't think the ugly 'shave 3/4  of 1/2 my head' was popular then•ÈÀ"
Spider ham looks more like porky pig wearing spider suit instead of his original design•ÈÀ
Mr. XD Where‰Ûªs Spiderman 2099? _Ù÷¢_Ù÷¢•ÈÀ
"@Javier Aviles Don't ask me, ask the producers. I'm not a big fan of 2099 so, I don't care that much, but I guess I'm not the only human being in the world XD•ÈÀ"
Mr. XD No ones perfect _Ù÷•ÈÀ

"Come on, you can't say a Trench coat clad Spider-Man voiced by Nicholas Cage isn't cool.•ÈÀ"

"I know they‰Ûªre saving some of the ‰ÛÏhigher stakes‰Û Spider-Verse stories (the inheritors, the web of life, etc.) for a sequel, but this just kinda seems like a conflict that doesn‰Ûªt really call for multiple Spider-People•ÈÀ"
I'm 99% sure Post Malone is Going to make a song for the movie•ÈÀ
Yaboi Longtolast OMG he better!•ÈÀ

Well this just solidified Marvel over DC for me•ÈÀ
"Anime Spider-Man?! Welp! I'm sold!•ÈÀ"
You're talking about that high school girl spider-man right? Because this animation is more of a comic style•ÈÀ
"I hate First Comments The heck are you going on about? Obviously they're talking about the middle school Japanese anime Spider-Man (who's name is Peni Parker, or SP//dr, by the way). The one at 1:36.•ÈÀ"
I know it's CGI but does Peni and Peter Porker are done in 2D animation and the rest are not?•ÈÀ
Yes.•ÈÀ

Yes the characters are but everything else is at 60 to give it a more comic book vibe•ÈÀ

Can someone tell me what this is? Like why are there different spidermans? Kinda havent kept up with spiderman at all.•ÈÀ
"Killer Boy Snap big comics companies like DC and Marvel have their own multiverses. Basically there is main universe with main characters, and hella ton of  other universes, like, A LOT . Those range from simple alternative future( what if Peter Parker didn‰Ûªt marry Mary Jane at that time) to completely different ones ( Universe where Spider- Man is leader of anarchist punk people fighting with government or where X-men are established by Magneto , for example).  Marvel Cinematic Universe, by the way, is one of those alternative worlds, with number 199999. So is latest Spider Man game on PlayStation. So this animated film is rough adaptation of ‰ÛÏMiles Morales: Spider Man‰Û comic book, ‰ÛÏSpider-Men‰Û storyline and ‰ÛÏSpider-verse‰Û event. Spider-verse was an event where Spider characters from all universes fought off their common enemy.‰ÛÏMiles Morales‰Û originally takes place in Ultimate universe. Peter was Spider-Man there, but he died at age of 16 while fighting Green Goblin. Miles got bitten by one of Oscorp spiders and decided to take up his mantle and  thus becomes second Spider-Man of that world.  The same story will probably happen to animated version  of the character.‰ÛÏSpider-Men‰Û storyline tells the story of how Peter from main Prime universe travelled to Ultimate universe, met Miles Morales, taught him things and learned truth about his counterpart‰Ûªs destiny. This animated film take a huge chunk out of that particular story.Now, Gwen Stacy is based on Earth-65 Gwen Stacy. She is one bitten by spider in that world. Peter becomes Lizard instead. She accidentally kills him  and decides to become superhero in order to redeem herself.The buff dude in black suit is adaptation of Spider-Man from Noir universe. The world of Noir is set in 1930s, during the Great Depression. Peter Parker lives in poor district controlled by local Mafia. His aunt May is killed by one of them. By lucky chance Peter is granted powers by some sort of Spider god. He uses his powers to avenge death of his family, kills bad dudes and becomes bloodlusted vigilante.Girl in big robot is animated version of Peni Parker. In original storyline she is daughter of ‰ÛÏsuperhero cop‰Û guy, who used a exo-suit named ‰ÛÏSp//dr‰Û to hunt enemy. Her dad is killed, and she is next one in line to work with the suit.  The animated version  seems to be more ‰ÛÏcheerful anime‰Û type and even her robot looks cuter than original.Last one is Spider-Ham. Basically a joke character from universe where everyone is an animal.Hope this clears things up.•ÈÀ"
"Long story short, the comic writers got bored, made a couple of Spider-Man-themed characters, and it kind of snowballed from there. This movie will feature the following Spider-People:Peter Parker, The Amazing Spider-Man: No introduction needed.Miles Morales, The Ultimate Spider-Man: A kid who got spider powers long after Peter's career started and is trying to be the next Spider-Man. He's the lead character in this movie.Gwen Stacy, The Sensational Spider-Gwen: Alternate version of Peter's first girlfriend who got spider powers instead of him.Peter Parker, The Spider-Man Noir: Alternate Peter Parker who got his powers in the 1930s.Peni Parker & SP//dr, The Spider-Mecha Duo: Relatively Unknown, but they are both based off of Japan Mecha animes. Spider-Ham: Looney Toons inspired joke character.•ÈÀ"
I'm only watching for that anime character•ÈÀ
Does animals talk in this dimension coz i don't wanna freak him out _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_ÙÕÛ_ÙÕÛ•ÈÀ
I'm actually surprised that there aren't any racist comments that's a great community unlike the starwars one... Great guys ‰_•ü•ÈÀ
I actually love soggy fries...•ÈÀ
If the MCU Spider-Man appears in this movie then he would be a pile of dust•ÈÀ
Last part got me hope it lives up•ÈÀ
"SP//DR and Spider-Ham. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, SONY•ÈÀ"
YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAH•ÈÀ
YO SPIDER-MAN PS4 suit behind Peter at 1:37•ÈÀ

The bit rate on this trailer is horrible•ÈÀ
Wait what.... Another one eh?•ÈÀ
I _ÙÕÑ spider-man•ÈÀ
"Okay, I MIGHT forgive Sony because of this.•ÈÀ"
You lost me at Gwen Stacey....•ÈÀ
Can they release the Christmas album Spidey made?•ÈÀ
Wow... Actually looks amazing!•ÈÀ
Is that wilson fisk?•ÈÀ
SlightlyNorfolk yep.•ÈÀ
I wish they did peter Parker young too•ÈÀ
2:30 miles is black panther confirmed•ÈÀ
Well they are both atrocious characters so yes you are correct.•ÈÀ
I understand that reference•ÈÀ
Wakanda forever!•ÈÀ
An animation for the new generation that they'll look back on  like we look back on Pixar movies. I truly believe this will be amazing•ÈÀ
OMG its John Mulaney•ÈÀ
Oh boy can‰Ûªt wait to see Sony screw this one up•ÈÀ
Imagine if Tobey Maguire came back to voice Spider-Man...•ÈÀ
imagine if this movie is live action as Spiderman 4•ÈÀ
"it basically is, this is Tobey's Spidey•ÈÀ"

Yes•ÈÀ
Who tf is Sam Rami?•ÈÀ
Yep. You're the only one.•ÈÀ
is Spider Gwen a Lesbia?•ÈÀ
"Shadow558 The Boss No. She was romantically interested in Miles, but they were forced to split.•ÈÀ"
why is her hair cut like that?•ÈÀ
"Shadow558 The Boss why not? It‰Ûªs just stylistic choice, to make her look ‰ÛÏcool and hip‰Û. Lesbians are not the only females that have short hair, you know.•ÈÀ"
"I realize that but in this trailer she kinda acted like she wasn't romanticly interested in them but she was acting like they were her bueddies, like how lesbians act a bit tough and boyish, like vandal savage's daughter in DC.•ÈÀ"
"Shadow558 The Boss well her character is written as tomboyish. Since her mother is dead, her father was overprotective of her. This made her a bit more masculine( because no female figure in her life) and a rebel( because her dad is authority as a father and police chief).  She is self confident, independent( she had to become one, since dad is always working), foolishly brave and arrogant. Her arrogance is what caused Peter Parker‰Ûªs death in her world, hence why she decided to become Spider-Woman/Ghost Spider.•ÈÀ"
"No, in the past, she have a crush in Peter (but he dead...)•ÈÀ"
"why r u being so defendent on this? It really isn't worth getting mad at me, it was a simple mistake dude.•ÈÀ"
"Shadow558 The Boss I‰Ûªm not mad at you, neither am I trying to piss you off( sorry if it looks that way). I just don‰Ûªt like unanswered questions and try to explain everything in detail for the full picture.•ÈÀ"
Ok...•ÈÀ
I am still to wait for an awesome spiderman story worth my time. They are killing a legend.•ÈÀ
It looks better than your grammar.•ÈÀ
"dat boi says the the guy that can't spell ""that boy"".•ÈÀ"

"Joseph Burns you are little late. Superman of Earth-9 was black, and he first appeared in 1998. Then in New 52, there are 2 black Supermen. First is Kalel from Earth 23.Second is Val-Zod, from Earth 2. He took the mantle after Kal-El of that universe died. Technically there is also Steel, who‰Ûªs basically black Superman of main universe, and that guy exists since 80s.•ÈÀ"
Joseph Burns this is based of the comic books so don‰Ûªt even start....god don‰Ûªt you assholes have anything better to do than to be so fucking obsessed with someone‰Ûªs ethnicity. It‰Ûªs weird•ÈÀ

"James GBut she acts like that? No? That's what I thought•ÈÀ"
"Amrlock h Her acting like one has nothing to do with what I said. She looks unappealing. Her hairstyle here looks freaking ugly for starters. It screams, ""I wanna complain to the manager of this barber shop"". I don't know why they decided to give her this ugly as sin hair instead of the hair she has in the comics.•ÈÀ"
"James GOk, her hair style ""scream"" that, but does she acts like that? I mean, he only acts like fucking Spider Gwen•ÈÀ"

This came out 2 days ago and it already got 10M views back•ÈÀ
Db super movie or this?•ÈÀ
In my opinion canon should only be peter parker•ÈÀ
Ace Fool then should we get rid of MCU Spider Man? He is not canon.•ÈÀ
AluTheHungryGhost umm my dude MCU Spiderman is peter parker•ÈÀ
"Ace Fool but he is different Peter Parker. His parents weren‰Ûªt SHIELD agents. He didn‰Ûªt make his own gadgets and proper suit, and got them from the Tony Stark.  He doesnt meet neither Betty Brant( host first gf) Gwen Stacy or Mary Jane or  Carlie Cooper. In fact in MCU he is with Michelle G. Thus, he doesn‰Ûªt have same life as real Peter, doesn‰Ûªt have same suit or powers as real Peter, he didn‰Ûªt kill people,as real Parker did. In fact, the only thing that makes him close with original Peter Parker is that he is white, male, and has same name.He is yet another alternative version of Spider Man, just like Spider Man Noir in this animated film, who s Peter Parker as well.•ÈÀ"
"AluTheHungryGhost He still has the same powers, Marvel‰Ûªs not showing the origin because it‰Ûªs well known already and would be a waste of time. And the Stark Suit (As named in Spider-Man PS4) is one of the closest suits to the comic suit. He has the same life, it‰Ûªs just more focused on High School as he‰Ûªs still young like in Ultimate Spider-Man comics.•ÈÀ"
"Raemonn Ramos  He doesn‰Ûªt have the same life. He is dating Michelle. Original Peter didn‰Ûªt know Michelle until after he got his masters degree. MCU Peter participated in ‰ÛÏCivil War‰Û when he was fifteen. Original Peter participated in civil war, when he was in his mid 20s, and not only those events are entirely different, but MCU Civil war had no impact on Peters life, whereas original Peter lost his aunt and  his daughter. MCU Peter‰Ûªs best friend is Ned Leeds. Original Peter didn‰Ûªt even know the guy that much outside of the job at Daily Bugle.Their life choices, their experience, their surroundings ( family, friends, lovers) are so different, they are not the same person. Just like Ultimate Peter is not same person as original Peter. Yes, he is his counterpart, but counterpart doesn‰Ûªt mean ‰ÛÏ same character‰Û.So if alternative versions like MCU Peter are allowed to exist, when why Miles or Peni cannot?•ÈÀ"
"Mister stark, i don't feel good..Because you are black lol.•ÈÀ"
1:36•ÈÀ
I'm happy it seems like they are putting focus on Miles developing into his own Spider-Man. I was worried they were gonna rush things and try to focus on all the characters instead of just the one.•ÈÀ
A black spiderman? Lololol I'm not racist but cmon.  And the black guy playing Spiderman is the protagonist from the movie 'Dope'•ÈÀ
I love how the black Spider-Man is the one you question even though there is a pig Spider-Man and an Asian robot controlling Spider-Man in this movie to. ¯»ôöô ô_•ÈÀ
"There's an anime Japanese schoolgirl Spidey who controls a mech, a talking pig, and a hardboiled noir detective voiced by Nicolas Cage but the black Spider-Man is where you draw the line?Sounds pretty racist to me.•ÈÀ"
I hope this is three hours or two•ÈÀ
Dang Sony! This movie ALMOST looks as good as your other masterpiece (of course I refer to the masterpiece that is the Emoji Movie.)•ÈÀ
No mames ahora es negro? :v•ÈÀ
I cant wait•ÈÀ
I actually can‰Ûªt wait for this movie to come out•ÈÀ
How can this trailer be #1 in Canada?•ÈÀ
i just dont like peter in this movie. not comical or funny enough•ÈÀ
"Ok, I'll say it... HE'S BLACK DUDE _Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
What's your point?•ÈÀ
@Ultinuc I just said it•ÈÀ
Can‰Ûªt wait to see Nicholas noir!•ÈÀ
Really love the blend of animation!! I'm hoping we get to explore more of each Spider•ÈÀ
...... Wtf is this... Too much spider man..... Theres only 1•ÈÀ
"Rare Gaming ugh... no? There is a whole multiverse of characters. If there was only one spider man, then MCU shouldn‰Ûªt exist.•ÈÀ"
The Rider became the Spider. How interesting...•ÈÀ
"If the animation style alone hasn't got you hyped, I don't know what will.•ÈÀ"
"Nice animation, but I got bored of Spider-Man ages ago. man if they would make a different movie with this studio I would love it even more. But this Spider-Man movie truly is awesome•ÈÀ"

Awesome playing the new spiderman game XD love it.•ÈÀ
ôÉ¯µ¯µ•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm just wondering where spider-man of 2099 is?•ÈÀ
or superior spider-man or ben reilly•ÈÀ
"I haven't read those comics, but is 2099 spidey from a different universe? Or is he just a future spiderman from the same universe as the OG Peter?•ÈÀ"
Yeah me too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That actually will be awesome in my opinion if the 2099 Spider Man was in this movie•ÈÀ
"Robin John Aranguiz different Spider-Man, not peter but I forgot who it was, and he‰Ûªs from the future•ÈÀ"
In the sequel lol•ÈÀ
@JAns Shns I think that his name is Miguel O Hara•ÈÀ
"Robin John Aranguiz It‰Ûªs very ambiguous, but he is meant to be in the future of the 616 earth. It usually depends on what the writer does as there isn‰Ûªt a definitive future of the 616 earth. Simplified answer is yes, he is from the same universe. I‰Ûªd recommend starting with Peter David‰Ûªs original series for Spider-Man 2099. Dan Slott also did a 2099 arc during Superior Spider-Man, where Miguel gets stuck in the present. This coincides with the 2014 run and volume 3 which began in 2015 and ended in 2017. There‰Ûªs also the Timestorm universe, but that‰Ûªs a completely different Miguel O‰ÛªHara.•ÈÀ"
"Jason Hu They‰Ûªll probably reveal him this weekend at New York Comic Con. I know they are doing Marvel Legends reveals, maybe we‰Ûªll get some more action figure reveals for this movie.•ÈÀ"
Jason Hu more like where is spider ben? Or ben reilly?•ÈÀ
"Spider-Man 2099 is already overused when it comes to these kinds of things (so is Spider-Ham and Noir but I think they're still pretty good choices). We got Shattered Dimension and Edge of Time both having 2099 and there's also the Ultimate Spider-Man show where they had Spider-Man 2099, Noir, and Spider-Ham (twice). There are more Spider-Men that we haven't seen being used before so seeing Noir and Ham being used again is kinda disappointing because we've already seen them before but I think they'll still be good characters for this movie anyway. There are so many other Spidey's that could've been used so a little more variety would've been great but this selection is still pretty good.•ÈÀ"
How's he gonna sling and crawl his way out of this one?•ÈÀ
Man this is going to be so good•ÈÀ
The new fortnite skins coming soon v:•ÈÀ
At least telltale gets to make this•ÈÀ

Find it weird that the only way they would allow a black spiderman was to make it animated _Ù_á_Ù_‰Û‰ªâ•ü•ÈÀ
"Or maybe-- just maybe, Miles doesn't fit into the live action movies yet, and if they made an out of continuity live action movie, it would confuse the general public (aka the majority of people who go see these movies) so they made it animated.But sure, go make it about race. If it was about race, this movie wouldn't even exist because it's not like anybody was asking for it•ÈÀ"

"Looks more like a fanfic than an actual Spiderman movie. I mean, anime girls and talking pigs? What the hell...•ÈÀ"
Spider-verse stories typically have Spider-Ham show up and usually when out in animation they like to mix up the art styles for different dimensions to show how different they are•ÈÀ

@jose manuel lagos ahumada valid•ÈÀ
@icefang111 assuming someone's sexuality just based on her haircut. Talking about forced LGBT•ÈÀ

"+pato sostenido   I know right? assuming someone's sexuality just based on a worldwide known trait they use to identify themselves........        Yeah, how dare we...•ÈÀ"
"@Adam J. Harper Oh, I have large hair. I suppose that makes me a woman since it's a worldwide known trait for women to have large hair. Also my grandma has really short hair, I suppose she was a lesbian all alone.•ÈÀ"
"Don't try to be pathetic and play the semantics game. Save yourself that hassle. Is not that is ""short haircut"". Short haircut would be something like Tea Leoni in Jurassic Park 3, or Scarlett Johansson in the first Avengers...    the haircut that Gwen uses in this, is shaven near the nape and cheeks, with the typical honeycomb form. Literally just Google ""lesbian haircut"" and it shows hers  _ÙÔÎ_Ù÷â•ÈÀ"

the different art and animation styles look absolutely incredible. So hyped for this movie.•ÈÀ
"Why couldn‰Ûªt we just get a movie with just Miles and Peter? You know, the only two great and beloved characters in this trailer?We don‰Ûªt need all these characters that were too unpopular to even show up in f*cking Ultimate Spiderman, when that show did this plotline.•ÈÀ"
Most of the characters did show up you know. Just spider Gwen who‰Ûªs getting her own animated TV show and the Japanese one with the mech•ÈÀ
"PhasmaniaThat is... That is going to be an even worse flop than Disney XD‰Ûªs 2nd Spiderman show. Spider Gwen does not warrant a show about her.•ÈÀ"
Spencer Whiteway so doesn't miles. Miles is literally the most boring character in the group. At least the others have some interesting trait.•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham showed up in Return To The Spider-Verse and Spider-Man Noir was In Shattered Dimensions so the only one with no love is Peni Parker•ÈÀ
szeax You clearly haven‰Ûªt read the Miles story. The successor to peter after he died with invisibility and electrification is less interesting than spider pig? Spider Gwen? Please.•ÈÀ
"Phasmania eh, more interesting than spidergwen. But it's not that interesting.•ÈÀ"
Phasmania definitely less interesting than spiderham•ÈÀ

what's the song that's playing in the trailer?•ÈÀ
Out a sight - the boogie•ÈÀ
Stop at 1:39 and look at the suit behind aunt May•ÈÀ
"This actually seems like a really well written fun film. What I will never understand is why they would make a conscious decision to go with the choppy 10 frame per second look. It doesn't emulate traditional animation, it just makes the film look like a badly optimized videogame.•ÈÀ"
"If they‰Ûªre gonna have Gwen Stacey, they have to reference what happened to her in Peter‰Ûªs universe. They can‰Ûªt not do that.•ÈÀ"

#nochickendinner•ÈÀ
"What is this, CGI or 2D animation? Or are they combined? Because it's looking clean as hell.•ÈÀ"
"I think it's just CGI, but made to look like a combination.•ÈÀ"
CGI made to look like stop motion.•ÈÀ
It's CGI but the designers just made it frame by frame with few delays to make it more look appealing like in 2d style of animation. That's how animators nailed with The Lego Movie; same method. Yes it's attempting to be a stop motion.•ÈÀ
So true•ÈÀ
"CGI rendered at a lower frame rate like that of a low budget afternoon cartoon. I kind'a like the anime feel it gives it.•ÈÀ"
"crossover from another dimension.. 1:02like peter parker from sam raimi trilogypeni parker from sp//drand that suit behind Aunt May is from Spiderman PS4.. 1:39•ÈÀ"
@Afsakomig honestly•ÈÀ
"CGI with reduced frames to create a stop motion esque movement.The Peanuts Movie used a similar style as well.•ÈÀ"
"With these 2 characters the Japanese girl and that spider pig dude, it looks confusing as hell. I couldn‰Ûªt tell if they were 2D or 3D? I mean it actually looks pretty mad cool!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ"
Game of Life Good catch•ÈÀ
"I believe that its called phong-shading. It's when you have a 3d model, but you refer it with a 2d material.•ÈÀ"
"It‰Ûªs defiantly CGI but it is made to look like the comic book style, that‰Ûªs why the characters often don‰Ûªt have realistic proportions such as the dad•ÈÀ"
It just kinda confusing though _Ù_Ó_Ù_Ó_Ù_Ó•ÈÀ
"Brayden Tidswell THIS PATH IS WHAT ALL MOVIES STRIVE FOR•ÈÀ"
They rendered with a toon style 3D shader.•ÈÀ
It‰Ûªs a comic book style 3D CGI.•ÈÀ
Nintendude 1216 it's made to look like a comic book style then all the other spider men/women have their own unique style like spider pig has a looney toons style of animation•ÈÀ
Unreal Engine 4•ÈÀ

2:16 peni cannot climb the walls?•ÈÀ

Gwen and Miles are keeping her in place which I find really cute I‰Ûªm guessing she‰Ûªs holding their backs and has her legs behind her there‰Ûªs still gotta be room for Spider-Ham to make it through though•ÈÀ
but if she is a spider girl why cannot climb the walls?•ÈÀ
Darktommy3 1:38 She got bitten by a spider and can telepathically control that robot.•ÈÀ
a different type of spider then•ÈÀ

"Seriously what's up with dumb comic book cops always trying to kill or arrest superheroes like Spiderman? Yeah. Yeah. I get it, he's a vigilante. And so doesn't have the authority over the law. But you also live in a universe where criminals have access to sci fi tech and magic, and constantly get invaded by aliens every week. So again, until you upgrade the tech tree for the police you idiots should be grateful for heroes like Spiderman risking their lives for no money while doing your jobs. There's dumb and there's Marvel comics human dumb. I mean let's say you do arrest or shoot him. What happens next time when Green Goblin or some other crazy villain is destroying the city and you police can't do squat? Who'll save you all then idiots? Also, when the Kree, Skruell, Hydra or Kang the conqueror tries to destroy or enslave you who else but the heroes would save you?•ÈÀ"
i am telling jamson about on you for being sympathetic toward spidey you lil rebel•ÈÀ
"It's simple they won't arrest them, simply just putting pressure on them to work positive.....Still debatable!!!•ÈÀ"
But.. But the Spider man is a menace!•ÈÀ
This is nothing compared to the crap Bay's Autobots have to deal with every movie.•ÈÀ
Niloy Nibir Bordoloi chill Bro•ÈÀ
"Niloy Nibir Bordoloi He‰Ûªs also doing bad things. And most people are in Spider-Man‰Ûªs side, so he is conveniently never captured by police•ÈÀ"
Calm down guys its not like thanos will wipe out that universe•ÈÀ
"@Blobfish He better not. The Spiderverse universe looks great.•ÈÀ"
"Funny you say ""marvel dumb"" but I'm pretty sure if we had a super hero here it would be the same thing. Although I bet the instant they get a solid clue the government would declare the whole family national threats and take every one of them in powers or no.•ÈÀ"
"Ok Sony, you win. Now I'm gonna watch for the loli Peni Parker•ÈÀ"
"WTF. There's an anime girl version of Spiderman?I mean I know about Miles, Noir, SpiderGwen and SpiderHam but this just came out of left field. Can someone please explain who this is?•ÈÀ"
"It's Peni Parker, aka, SP//dr. She's from the Spider-Verse comic canon. Fights crime with a spider-mecha via a mind-link to a spider that bit her.•ÈÀ"

Um... i am a avid comic book reader and i dont feel the quality has went down at all. i feel the other people try way to hard to seem like they are comic gurus by saying stuff like this•ÈÀ
"I know what you are talking about but this isn't one of those. This actually pretty good movie that happens to have a diverse cast, not a diverse cast put into a movie.•ÈÀ"

"(The parable of the wedding feast):The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.all things are ready: come unto the marriage. But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:Then saith he to his servants,The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good:and the wedding was furnished with guests.And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he saith unto him,Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.Then said the king to the servants,Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (HELL!)For many are called,but few are chosen.(Matthew 22:2-3;4-5; 8-10;11-14).***The King is God the Father and the Son is Jesus.***The invitations were sent out long before the celebration so the people would have plenty of time to get ready.***(They made light of it): Means they did not care about it. They were so preoccupied with the here and now that they had no concern for God's kingdom.***The indifferent response in V.5 describes Israel at the time of Jesus earthly ministry.***(Both bad and Good): Probably refers to Jews and Gentiles. The morally evil and the morally good. The important point to recognize is that this group responded to the invitation, while those who had received special invitations had spurned the king's bidding.***(Did not have on a wedding garment): Like the others, this visitor had been invited to the wedding but he failed to prepare himself for it.----->I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. (Revelation 3:18).***In Revelation, the garments of (fine linen) worn by the (bride of the Lamb) is said to be the (righteous deeds) of the (saints).----------->And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the (fine linen) is the (righteousness of saints).(Revelation 19:8).***In this parable, the garment may refer to the righteousness of Christ graciously provided for us though his death. To refuse to put it on would mean a refusal of Christ's sacrifice.***If we want to enter Christ's banquet, we must ""Put on"" the righteousness he gives us. ---->And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. (Ephesians 4:24). ---->And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: (Colossians 3:10).***Someone claiming to belong at the wedding while refusing to wear the correct garments was similar to the Israelites who claimed to be God's people while refusing to OBEY HIM.***(Cast...into outer darkness): Referring to the judgment--->Hell...***(Many are called, but few are chosen): The word called in this instance refers to being ""invited"", not to the call of God as Paul used the word. (Rom 8:28-29).***All Israel had been invited, but only a few would (accept) and (follow Jesus). Not all those invited will be among the chosen of God, for not (all will believe).•ÈÀ"

"Spiderman was white in the canon, not black. I understand how diversity is being pushed so hard in the 21st century but this is unacceptable.•ÈÀ"
You do realize Miles Morales has taken the mantle of Spider-Man in the Ultimate Universe right? You also realize 2099 Spider-Man is Hispanic right?•ÈÀ
There's like several hundred spiderpeeps•ÈÀ

So tobey Maguire spiderman it's canon. Nice•ÈÀ
"No, it's a reference. There's a diference•ÈÀ"
"I find it baffling that people think its the Macguire Spider-Man, but completely ignore that these two characters have extremely different personality. Wildly different. They threw in the references as gags, same as the PS4 game.•ÈÀ"
Probably gonna be the best comic book movie ever.•ÈÀ
Partial disclosure .. loving it thanks•ÈÀ
this was a really nice movie loved so much too bad it was short•ÈÀ
It isn't out yet•ÈÀ

the animation though its flawless _Ù÷•ÈÀ
Everybody would have flipped if Tobey voiced peter•ÈÀ
I would have loved that.•ÈÀ
Too Legit but he isn‰Ûªt very good at voice acting•ÈÀ
@dabbo what do you mean not good at acting•ÈÀ
VOICE acting•ÈÀ
"@dabbo I really haven't thought about his voice acting skills ,but the only reason i would love that (even if the voice acting is bad) is becuase of nostalgia since the toby was in my childhood movies which i repeated atleast two times per day everyday.•ÈÀ"
Too Legit nostalgia over talent... ok•ÈÀ
"@olga Garcia Well its my opinion. Of course majority of people would prefer him not be there ,but im not critical about acting. Doi•ÈÀ"
It would be nice if he made a cameo as one of the spidermen•ÈÀ
I would‰Ûªve loved to see Josh Keaton as Spider-Man•ÈÀ
I would have cried tears of joy•ÈÀ
Who's everybody? Toby spiderman was meh•ÈÀ

There has been more than one Spider-Man for longer than you've been alive. Plus most of the different Spider-Men are also name Peter Parker•ÈÀ
There are infinite•ÈÀ
@UniqueNameGuy Most of the new spidermans were created long after Stan Lee's Peter Parker. As far as I'm concerned the only spiderman is the one that Stan Lee created.•ÈÀ

Black spiderman.  Next: Spider woman. Because equality sells.•ÈÀ
The Watchful Hunter retardism at its finest right here folks•ÈÀ
If you do some research you'll realize how much of an asshat you just sounded. Miles Morales had taken the Spider mantle in the Ultimate Universe comic years ago after Peters death fighting the S6. You'll also realize 2099 Spider-Man is Hispanic. But if you actually sit down and work your brain with research you're gonna hate when you find out Spider-Woman and Spider-Girl was around in the mid 2000's Jackass•ÈÀ

Is that a Japanese Anime girl...with her Spider-Mecha?•ÈÀ
I HAVE NO CLUE xD•ÈÀ
"She's Peni Parker, who fights crime as ""SP//dr"". She's a 14 year old Japanese girl who's got a mental link to a radioactive spider that bit her and is the only person who can pilot the spider-mecha as a result.•ÈÀ"
"James G So instead of wearing tight suit that symbolize like a Spider, she came up with her own idea of fighting crime using the old AND modern Japanese genius-inventor-nerd tradition, and that is riding a Spider-mecha SUIT?!•ÈÀ"
DxW 00 She actually took over being SP//dr from her father after he died. He's the one who made the spider-mecha. She let herself get purposefully bitten by the radioactive spider so that she would be able to pilot the mecha.•ÈÀ
The comic she first appeared in was written by the guy from My Chemical Romance.•ÈÀ
FREAKING SPIDER PIG HECK YEAH NOW IM HYPED•ÈÀ
"being a longtime fan of My Chem and Gerard Way. I can say that i‰Ûªm incredibly proud and super stoked that Peni Parker (a character he created for Spider-Verse #5) is getting to be a big part of this film. i‰Ûªm crying rn. i didn‰Ûªt think a day like this would come but it‰Ûªs one of the best feelings a former (do we really stop?) emo kid could have rn. much love, Gerard. you made it (yet again)•ÈÀ"

@J R I'm not salty tho•ÈÀ

All I want from this movie is at least one apearence from the Japanese giant robot piloting spiderman•ÈÀ

Trilogy _Ù÷â_Ù_£ lol•ÈÀ
that spiderman you're talking about came from the spiderverse where tobey was Spiderman•ÈÀ

I love the way it looks like a comic book!•ÈÀ
The animation is orgasmically beautiful.•ÈÀ
The animation is still better than Star Wars Resistance. Bravo Sony. You beat Disney at something•ÈÀ
I love how at 1:40 when Spider-Ham is walking up to greet everyone Peter isn't even wearing matching shoes.•ÈÀ
this animation looks amazing•ÈÀ
looks like a Disney Channel morning cartoon for little kids•ÈÀ
Has a comic feel to it. Sony is doing something right!•ÈÀ
"Mournin Disney channle cartoons have a budget of like, 3 bucks•ÈÀ"
@Gui Likes The Dark that's what I'm getting at•ÈÀ
Its normal animation in 24 fps•ÈÀ
People had problems with the frame rate but I think it's very cool on how they did it•ÈÀ
@Scud you are right about the frame rate•ÈÀ
Më£_âUEM true•ÈÀ
The art style is amazing. I need to know how they do this stuff.•ÈÀ
But some Japanese animation style Spiderman wouldn't be bad.•ÈÀ
It's super stylized.•ÈÀ
The frames are pretty bad though•ÈÀ
@Ryan Le It's a style choice meant to make it look like flipping comic panels. You get used to it.•ÈÀ
Syntherus sure they‰Ûªre just saying that so they can justify having less FPS•ÈÀ
"@Dell12 16 There's no reason for them make that sort of budget cut. Besides, it makes sense in the context of the characters. It's actually a lot smoother than it was in the initial reveal. They just tweaked the style. It's basically stop motion.•ÈÀ"
"S O N Y  A N I M A T I O N S  M O T H E R F U C K E R. The Emoji Movie was a masterpiece on all levels, and the only thing you say about another one of their movies is "" Beh, gud animates blehhhhhh""•ÈÀ"

"Would agree, but too much stuttering in the movement.. totally distracting and detracting. Feels like the animation used in ‰ÛÏTron: Uprising‰Û. Will wait for rental, but happy there is at least an effort being made. <thwip-out>•ÈÀ"
I don't think so at all: I think it looks incredibly lame. Give us the 3d CGI.•ÈÀ
"Yah look amazing, it make me draw the character movie in my channel.•ÈÀ"

I will admit it is a little stilted but i think that adds to its charm. But i cant see what you mean by inconsistent do you think you could explain whats so inconsistsnt about it?•ÈÀ
@shadowX1312 it transitions between 60fps and like 25fps inconsistently•ÈÀ

Why is Spider-Man black?•ÈÀ
PlaceOfOrigin It's Miles Morales. Takes up the mantle of Spiderman after Peter dies.•ÈÀ
PlaceOfOrigin I love you question how Spider-Man is black but not that he is also a talking pig.•ÈÀ
MrLondonuts what do mean he‰Ûªs a talking pig? That doesn‰Ûªt make sense. I can‰Ûªt understand why thy were pressured into making spider-man black? Can a white person play the character Shaft if they ever make another film? Doubt it.•ÈÀ
"PlaceOfOrigin did you even watch the trailer? There is a pig Spider-Man in this movie aswell, there is also an Asian girl who controls a robot spider. You don‰Ûªt have a problem with that, but once Spider-Man is black it‰Ûªs an issue???•ÈÀ"
MrLondonuts I don‰Ûªt mind suspending reality and watching talking pigs. But we both know that this spider-man is black because of some sort of social equality. It‰Ûªs ridiculous.•ÈÀ
MrLondonuts there would be a huge outcry if Shaft was cast as a white man. Tell me the difference?•ÈÀ
"PlaceOfOrigin There is also a female Spider-Man and an Asian Spider-Man in this film. No problem with them? But the black one Oooo something is wrong there.And no we don‰Ûªt both know that. This is a film about different dimension spider people, these characters are all characters that have been established throughout the last 50 years in comic books.  Miles is a popular alternate Spider-Man and has existed for ages, so he just happens to be in this film, you making a big deal over nothing, what would you have preferred if they turned miles white??•ÈÀ"
"MrLondonuts the pig, the woman, the Asian, are not ACTUALLY spider-man though, are they? Now you‰Ûªre going to say ‰ÛÏwell, Morales isn‰Ûªt actually Spider-man either, he‰Ûªs taking over from Peter Parker‰Û. But you don‰Ûªt see it, do you? They SPECIFICALLY making him black. Which isn‰Ûªt right. I have no agenda but I totally disagree with being shamed into feeling that ‰ÛÏwhites‰Û have had their way for too long and it‰Ûªs time for a change. It‰Ûªs an awful ideology. The pig, the woman, the Asian, that‰Ûªs NOT the point.•ÈÀ"
"MrLondonuts spider-man is a white person. Is that such a bad thing? If you want a pig as a superhero or a woman or an Asian then by all means write something and hey-ho, good luck to you. By why take a character who is white and change their race? It‰Ûªs not only spider-man that this happened to. I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªve seen other examples.•ÈÀ"
"PlaceOfOrigin what do you mean ‰ÛÏSpider-Man is white‰Û did you not see the trailer, you are like completely missing the point and again, I don‰Ûªt understand why there is no problem with an Asian Spider-Man and animal Spider-Man and yes, they are all spider men/people. They are from alternate universe and are the spider person from thier respective universe. Ok using your logic. What about spider Gwen, the original Spider-Man is a boy but she‰Ûªs a girl, why is there no issue thier either. You make no sense, you have a problem with him being black and you think there is some hidden agenda there. The only way a black Spider-Man would be an issue is if they called him Peter Parker and he was just   Written as peter but black, that would be an issue, but miles is a different character with spider abilities, he has a different story just like peni Parker just like peter porker and just like Gwen. THERE IS NO ISSUE LOL. And your acting like peter isn‰Ûªt in this, he is there and a main character in this story. Again, would you prefer if they made miles and peni white? Made Gwen a boy? Made peter porker a human? Where is your line?•ÈÀ"
"Pig - Gets bitten by radioactive spider. OKJapanese girl - Gets bitten by a radioactive spider.OKAfrican person - bitten by a radioactive spiderWTF NO THIS IS WRONG SPIDERMAN IS WHITE.That‰Ûªs you. That‰Ûªs you right now.•ÈÀ"
MrLondonuts 95% of the trailer is about Miles Morales. NOT the woman NOT the pig NOT the Asian. It‰Ûªs called slight of hand. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS MILES MORALES. They are changing spider-man‰Ûªs race.•ÈÀ
"PlaceOfOrigin ‰ÛÏthey are changing Spider-Man‰Ûªs race‰Û THERE ARE MULTIPLE SPIDER PEOPLE, they come in different shapes ages races and sizes, that‰Ûªs not an issue and have no idea why you see it as so. Of course the movie has to have a focus, the focus is in miles universe,  that‰Ûªs where all the characters end up, miles universe is different to peters and we‰Ûªve seen peters universe a billion times,as I said earlier if they changed peters race to black that would be an issue but Miles morales Isn‰Ûªt peter Parker, Gwen isn‰Ûªt peter Parker, peni Parker isn‰Ûªt peter, Parker, peter porker isn‰Ûªt peter Parker but like or not my guy, they are all SPIDERMAAAAN. They are all different in their own ways and that‰Ûªs ok. Honestly it‰Ûªs unfortunate there are people out there who see different as wrong. If you had a problem with any Spider-Man that wasn‰Ûªt white, I‰Ûªd probably just leave you be but the fact that out of all the different spider people in this film the one you have the problem with is the black one is just odd.  That‰Ûªs all•ÈÀ"
MrLondonuts you‰Ûªre being an apologist.•ÈÀ
PlaceOfOrigin You know what after heavy thinking I‰Ûªve come to the conclusion that you are right. Spider-Man can and should only be white how dare they make him a pig! Let‰Ûªs sue the pig race. We want our friendly neighbourhood Caucasian Spider-Man! How dare Hollywood push their pig agenda on us.•ÈÀ

I‰Ûªm so excited for this ‰ª´•ü‰ª´•ü‰ª´•ü•ÈÀ
The most unique animation style I have ever seen.•ÈÀ
Yeah it is unique.•ÈÀ
Comic style. As if their  flipping pages to animate•ÈÀ
@Dale Hanson reminds me of kubo and the two strings. Now that was unique•ÈÀ
"Yah it‰Ûªs got this insane mix of 2D effects, fully 2D characters,  3D animation, and a neat stop motion aesthetic•ÈÀ"
More like styles!  Each of the spider-people look like they're from a different comic book. I'm pretty sure spider-ham is actually 2D•ÈÀ
It‰Ûªs terrible.•ÈÀ
The stop motion aesthetic is becoming more common place. The Dragon Prince did it too.•ÈÀ
"@Flazzy Fire ???•ÈÀ"
Reminds me of the vintage comic book out fit in the spiderman game but a little different•ÈÀ
"yea, they did it, badly.•ÈÀ"
It reminds me of the Lego movie•ÈÀ
it reminds me of a better version of the Telltale games (RIP Telltale)•ÈÀ
it like the graphics for Ones Justice•ÈÀ
Its more like kubo and coraline but more smother•ÈÀ
@Adrian Hernandez.J kubo and coraline used 3d printed stop motion. This was hand and compiter animated then dropped to 24fps i think to achieve stop motion•ÈÀ
"@Ramla Munye that technique is called cel shading. Its prevelant in archer and, like mentioned, telltale games.•ÈÀ"
"How can something be ""most"" unique?•ÈÀ"
Theres something so charming about it•ÈÀ
"I like how the three lead Spider-People have similar styles, and then the other three have mono-colors, japanimation and classic cartoon styles. Even if Peter, Miles, and Gwen are the leads, they at least got a diverse supporting cast.•ÈÀ"
Is it for me only? The whole video looks like choppy as hell.•ÈÀ

"Idea: in this universe, trump actually did nuke korea. Unfortunately, this catalyzed world war 3. Millions, maybe even a billion were killed but after many bitter years of fighting, america had finally lost the 3rd great war. The other countries (ie korea china ect) wanted justice for all the brave men and women they'd lost in the war and they demanded hefty reparations from america, money america didn't have. Left with no other choice, President Kanye was forced to inflate the dollar until a small meal might cost upwards from 30 000$ in order to pay reparations to the other countries. At the moment in the spiderman universe, they are in a horrible depression, capitalism is failing, unemployment rates have never been higher, and unfortunately, world war 4 might be the only thing that can pull america out of this horrible economic climate.So yup, world war 3 confirmed in this universe•ÈÀ"

The trailer alone is better than the whole emoji movie.•ÈÀ
Everything is•ÈÀ
"what are you talking about, the emoji movie is a literal masterpiece beyond human belief•ÈÀ"
The music in this trailer got me too hyped•ÈÀ
@Dr. Chopsticc technically you're trying to say that Stalin wasn't a bad person•ÈÀ

@msjhdbwbhsh clearly your mind cannot grasp the concept of a joke•ÈÀ
"Moral of the story: white people should teach young black children how to be heroic so that once white people are replaced by black people, they will leave the United States in good hands.•ÈÀ"

Gwen looks like a whiny sjw. No doubt they'll try to push some agenda in this flick..•ÈÀ
"Core Voltage ""this character is designed a way.. they're pushing an agenda""•ÈÀ"
@szeax Have you read marvel comics as of late?•ÈÀ
"Core Voltage yes, but marvel has literally no creative control in the slightest•ÈÀ"
Boring and stupid like libtarda•ÈÀ
cromeaxe no•ÈÀ

I feel like this movie should‰Ûªve tied in with the game it feels weird with myles dad being alive•ÈÀ

dude. spidey rox•ÈÀ
How is there a difference I mean sony you made a spiderman game with miles and peter in the same dimension so theoretically there is no dimensions according to the game play it you'll see what I mean•ÈÀ
"Adam Oneilwilliams the game is different from the movie, it isn't canon•ÈÀ"
I guess you're right but it's weird if you play the game the voices are different•ÈÀ
And we have the Sony typically Cola ad. Oh well•ÈÀ
"Nice video #rasyidtuber•ÈÀ"
VILLAN!!!!?????•ÈÀ
how does miles morales' dad know spiderman if he's from another universe•ÈÀ
a x o l o t l Spider-Man died in theirs and Miles Became the new Spider-Man•ÈÀ
This still can't compare to the emoji movie•ÈÀ
Honestly trailers should be no longer then 60 seconds•ÈÀ
Do animals speak in this dimension _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
"Too many spider's I just want Miles•ÈÀ"

"Miles is from 1610.He moved to 616 after the incursion etc people liked him a lot so they just needed a reason to move him•ÈÀ"
Ramki Asmath I‰Ûªm pretty sure this peter is the McGuire one not 616•ÈÀ
Raimi films are great i don't think so because at the beginning those 3 scenes seem more like references to me•ÈÀ
"Wait, is this movie canon to all of those universes? Or is this just a fun what-if story?•ÈÀ"
TheDiego908 I hope it‰Ûªs canon for raimis universe so we can finally see Pete‰Ûªs story come to a close•ÈÀ
"This choppy animation really grinds my gears, it's very hard on the eyes•ÈÀ"
It's not the animation it's the frame rate. It's usually 25 or over this movie/trailer is like 10fps at some points•ÈÀ

A black Spiderman? With a father still in his life?!!?!! What kind of sick backwards world is this.•ÈÀ
"I was expecting Amazing Spiderman 3 _Ùªã•ÈÀ"
Rajanikant amazing Spiderman is the worse version. He didn't act like Peter parker at all in the movie. Just a Popular snotty teenager who wasn't nerdy or shy at all. Spiderman is the only time Peter gets funny not without the costume Wich is why people like the original Spiderman movies more•ÈÀ
Ok whare the hell is one above all?•ÈÀ
Spiderpig...... okay im interested•ÈÀ
I dislike the 12fps look•ÈÀ
Spider-Man from Queens not Wakanda.•ÈÀ
...what•ÈÀ
Release this movie in tamil also dude•ÈÀ
Amazing love it waiting for movie•ÈÀ
How does Noir Spider-Man stick to the wall? In the comics he can't stick because he wears rubber gloves.•ÈÀ
Hes between two other spider people. Maybe theyre holding him up?•ÈÀ
"lucas Pretty sure most spider-men have the ability to manipulate magnetic fields to stick to walls rather than having actual sticky hands. This is why electro can disable spider-mans wall crawling•ÈÀ"
"its cagequestion it and you die•ÈÀ"
"In the original series he can't, but, for the spider-verse event and the following stories they just gave him the power to do it to fit in with the rest of the spiders that's why he can do it in this movie•ÈÀ"
So it's a power he obtained in the Spyder-verse crossover.•ÈÀ
_ÙªÎ•ÈÀ
Can someone tell me what song this is?•ÈÀ

That black kid is Miles Morales. Peter Parker is dead in his universe so he took the responsibility to the next spiderman.•ÈÀ
Milind Shekhawat Ye but it‰Ûªs opposite dimension so odd he wouldn‰Ûªt be called peter parker•ÈÀ
Not opposite universe•ÈÀ

Miles Morales is not from 616.•ÈÀ

What about that anime spider girl•ÈÀ

This Peter Parker is not from the 616 universe•ÈÀ
Toaster Strudel that‰Ûªs peni parker•ÈÀ
"@Patrick Nugee A Tiki statue broke during a heist, spilling a bunch of magic spiders all over the place. It's why he has organic webbing instead of mechanical. It's pretty cool. His suit is Uncle Ben's old fighter pilot uniform he wore in WW1 I think.•ÈÀ"
Miles is from the ultimate universe•ÈÀ
How do you nerds know all this•ÈÀ

Thanks•ÈÀ

"""-Spider man - Earth 616 (the classic) "" He doesn't seem like 616 Pete though. Seems like a completely new one or maybe one that's an amalgamation of a bunch of the Peters into one mentor character. He went through the same stuff as the Pete from the original movie trilogy but his personality doesn't seem to actually be that Pete. Also this version of Miles does not seem to be the same Miles from the comics (the one who originated from 1610 but was ported over to the 616). Would have been dope if the Pete mentoring Miles was indeed the one from the Sam Raimi universe complete with Tobey as the voice actor.•ÈÀ"

@AnotherOcto But Donald Glover is awesome. Maybe the cinematic version can be a little bit different.•ÈÀ
Debasish kutruka Because Donald Glover is already the uncle of Miles Morales in the MCU? Ever thought about that?•ÈÀ
"@Ace20A But that was a deleted scene. And I am not saying that it should happen but it would've been awesome to see Donald Glover become spider man. And I don't know whether they are going to use him as prowler in ""far from home"" or not.•ÈÀ"
Donald glover is miles' uncle•ÈÀ

"I want to support this movie because it‰Ûªs Spider-Man & I love the character to death, but I have issues with it:1. Peter Parker should be the focus; was never a fan of miles morales.2. The art style reminds me too much of cloudy with a chance of meatballs/hotel trannslyvania‰Ûªs and the animation itself doesn‰Ûªt look fluid at all.3. Sony is making this movie. I don‰Ûªt trust them with anything related to Spider-Man after the Amazing Spider-Man. And before anyone brings up Homecoming know this: Marvel Studios was the one who actually made the film, Sony is the one who paid for the production.•ÈÀ"

A japanese Spider-Girl from Earth-14512•ÈÀ
You just said you LITERALLY know every spider man and then asked who one of them is.....•ÈÀ
@SD Brand THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING! I KNOW ALMOST EVERY SPIDERMAN AND I'M CLUELESS TO WHO SHE IS JEEZ SRRY FOR ASKIN A QUESTION•ÈÀ
@Burning Ice Words have meanings. I literally know every spiderman and I know almost every spiderman are 2 different things.•ÈÀ

Wow spiderman's short•ÈÀ
Are they just cranking these movies out so they can stick the toys in McDonald‰Ûªs happy meals?•ÈÀ
I'm thinking they are cranking them out because they are insanely popular and make millions of dollars for the studios making them.....•ÈÀ
SD Brand Just like McDonald‰Ûªs happy meals?•ÈÀ
@uslsuspect Yes actually. . ... but that didn't back up your original statement whatsoever....•ÈÀ
SD Brand then let me be more clear: You were supporting the decision to make these movies based on their popularity. One of the most popular restaurants in the world is McDonald‰Ûªs. One of the most popular cars is probably the Ford Focus. Popular does not equal quality. Perhaps were saying the same thing. They keep making the movies because they make money. I was surprised to see that Jerry Springer was on the air for two decades but I guess if the money is rolling in why quit putting out material. I don‰Ûªt wanna argue with you. I hope it meets your expectations.•ÈÀ
@uslsuspect Again you jave strayed so far from what your original point was.. ...•ÈÀ
SD Brand You strayed so far that you left your sentence with an ellipses.•ÈÀ
"@uslsuspect Thank you for further proving my point, child.•ÈÀ"
SD Brand Aren‰Ûªt you the one who‰Ûªs into Spiderman movies?•ÈÀ

dreman999 I cant understand if that was meant to be an insult.•ÈÀ
"MrPotatoehead69 How is he a ""cheap"" character?•ÈÀ"
Sven Tempest they killed Peter Parker just so they can bring a new Spider-Man that is black .•ÈÀ
MrPotatoehead69 love how you only have a problem with the black Spider-Man even though there are several other spidermen in this film like the pig.•ÈÀ
@MrPotatoehead69 What have you got against black?•ÈÀ
MrPotatoehead69 Miles Morales has been around for a long time.•ÈÀ
"Dumb Boi only for like 6 years, that isn‰Ûªt long.•ÈÀ"
MrPotatoehead69 A lot can happen in 6 years•ÈÀ
"Dumb Boi ok, but you said he‰Ûªs been a character for a ‰ÛÏlong‰Û time•ÈÀ"
I'm glad one of the big production companies finaly decided to take a risk with animation•ÈÀ
"I'm here because it's not God's will that any of you perish but all of you repent to receive eternal life. Many people are not prepared for the return of Jesus Christ. I've seen Him and He looks nothing like the famous pictures. He is coming back soon to judge the world. Repentance is a gift, now is the time to seek Him and turn away from all wrongful acts before it's too late.Many die suddenly and unexpectedly everyday, these are our friends and family. They enter hell for all eternity, because they died without Jesus Christ. I don't wish to see anyone of you in agony for all eternity. I'm in oneness with God's will. He loves and cares for you all.You have the voice to change the eternal destination of your friends and family members, if your willing. God will not force His will on anyone. If you care about them than you know the right decision, come work for the only kingdom that will last forever, if your willing. I wish to see many of you changed into the image of Christ and all for His Glory. I wish to see all you guys reunited in God's kingdom with your friends and family, but that will not happen unless you are willing to do God's will.If your willing seek God with all your heart until you find Him. He will speak to you at His time, once He does obey Him until the end, and even unto death. Your reward will be with Him in the only kingdom that will last forever, heaven.Take care and God bless you•ÈÀ"

"Peace, Here is an online english translation of the Quran - W W W . Q U R A N . C O M please read it, or listen to the english translation on youtube. Also if you believe in God and believe Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final prophet and messenger sent by God. Then say 'Ash hadu ana la ilaha ill Allah wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa Rasul Allah"" ""I bear witness there is nothing worthy of worship except God and prophet Muhammad is his last an final messenger"" Those words are the ticket to paradise. When you say that all your sins are forgiven by God and all your good deeds stay with you and you become a Muslim. A Muslim is a person who peacefully submit's his will to God. Once you become a Muslim you have joined a family of over a billion people. After saying the shahadah straight away you are guaranteed paradise Masha'Allah _Ù÷Û Peace•ÈÀ"

Bod Dylan what‰Ûªs the issue with him being black?•ÈÀ
@MrLondonuts why make him black when hes always been white ??? It was pushed for last year that more comic book heroes become black or any race none white to NOT OFFEND anyone . Fairplay if the creater was white but hes not and the origins of spiderman are not that of a blackman . Its a pc move caked in bullshit•ÈÀ
"Bod Dylan So let me get this straight, it‰Ûªs a problem when Spider-Man is black but it‰Ûªs not a problem when he is a pig? Or an Asian girl?•ÈÀ"

Any small youtubers wanna support each other?‰_•ü•ÈÀ
thanks Sony for trying something different.•ÈÀ
"How does a lower frame rate resemble a comic book though? This is an animated movie, and it feels so off being so choppy with an artsyle that looks like it should be smooth. Anyways besides that this looks pretty good and I'll definitely give it a watch•ÈÀ"
Never understood that excuse people are making up for this flick.•ÈÀ
It's like turning a page when reading a comic. That's what I'm understanding.•ÈÀ
"@MrAmazing79 that's what I kinda thought at first, but that's not an animation style, that's not how comic books really work, its not a flipbook, it's different panels with different pictures. When the Lego movie's animation looked like stop motion it made sense because of all of the fan films created through stop motion. But comic books aren't an animation style, it's just pictures, there is no movement•ÈÀ"
It‰Ûªs almost like a stop motion animation now if you don‰Ûªt like it too bad so stop whining or you‰Ûªll turn from semi decent to head unpleasant•ÈÀ
"@Kleckio I'm not whining, I'm just pointing out it's not a good reason to slow down the frame rate. If you like it cool, but dont let other people not liking something bother you so much•ÈÀ"
Sorry it‰Ûªs just that I was really pissed off•ÈÀ
"your'e fine man, no hard feelings•ÈÀ"
Though I‰Ûªm pretty sure by the art style they couldn‰Ûªt raise the framerate•ÈÀ
Will Peter Parker feel good after this?•ÈÀ
"Wonderfully spiderman..Enjoying eyes•ÈÀ"
"the animation is super uncanny valley, idk man its weird but itll be interesting•ÈÀ"
Please Sony just leave the live action to Marvel and keep doing these animated ones! This movie looks really great.•ÈÀ
Gives a whole new fresh look at Spiderman using new art. I'm impressed.•ÈÀ

Sony has a Spiderman game and then makes a Spiderman movie. Why didn't they follow the story from the game of how miles dad saves Spiderman and dies and then miles gets bit by a spider. In my opinion that is better than different dimensions.•ÈÀ

"Hikarizu1 Yeah. It‰Ûªs part of his animation style, along with the edge tracing, to make him feel more like a comic book. I‰Ûªm sure Miles, Peter, and Gwen have different animation styles. They may be harder to see straight up, but they may have different styles of walking/moving and other animation effects (like Peter‰Ûªs lower FPS effect), and possibly even slightly different shaders.•ÈÀ"

Look guys this movie looks fantastic but they really should have done something with Spider-Man 2099 because he has probably been in more games than any other Spider-Man variant (Besides Peter Parker) and I mean when I think of other spidermen he is the first one to come to mind and I just think he could have been a great addition and character to this movie but I mean this movie is going to be great. Like or reply if you agree!•ÈÀ
"Jay Zajkowski he's been in like 3 spiderman games, and noir has appeared the same amount of times, and he's not a popular character•ÈÀ"
Noir has been in more cartoons and shows than him and yeah he has his own game with Spider-Man  but still I mean he‰Ûªs definitely a popular character there is no way to argue he isn‰Ûªt•ÈÀ
Noir is also a popular character by far•ÈÀ

Omg noir yass•ÈÀ
Tay k became spiderman?! But he told us SCHOOL WAS VERY HARD•ÈÀ
So much lag wtf•ÈÀ
I am optimistic about this. It doesn't have potty humor in the trailer like most animated children's movies of the last few years. Plus it has a unique style of animation.•ÈÀ
"I can‰Ûªt wait to watch this movie!Anyone else a REALLY BIG FAN of Spider-Man?•ÈÀ"
"Telltale Games animation style inspired...your welcome.  Recommend all their games btw, if you like character decision oriented games!•ÈÀ"
"No, it's inspired by comic books. You know, like Telltale Games was....•ÈÀ"
Who else noticed the reference to the original Spider-Man movies? This really brings a smile to my face(:•ÈÀ

Peter Parker in this is not Peter Parkery•ÈÀ
I want Peter Parker‰Ûªs coat•ÈÀ
"I'm surprised that Peni (I edited) Parker is so fucking ANIME around the others who look so different compared to her in this American animated film...it's weird but I somehow love this.Peter Porker/Spider-Ham is simply great. It's like he's from Looney Tunes or something lol•ÈÀ"
"RichDXtreme247 she is peni parker, the mecha spider man.•ÈÀ"
"She's Peni Parker, she's was part of the Spider-Verse canon in the comics. Her entire thing is that she's got a psychic link to a spider and can use that to control this spider-mecha suit. Her character and comic stories are inspired a lot by anime tropes obviously, but she looked a lot less ""kawaii-anime"" in the comics. I guess they really wanted to empathise her anime gimmick in the movie, since she's basically the ""anime representative"" of the Spider crew.•ÈÀ"
"Huh...I never knew there was another Pen-type Parker (I heard of Penny/Penelope Parker - Earth 11). This is the first time I've ever heard of ""Peni"". Interesting. I like it.•ÈÀ"
Why does Peter sound so raspy though?•ÈÀ
30 fps•ÈÀ
Maybe the Spider-Man 2099 will appear•ÈÀ
That's not spiderman though :/•ÈÀ
steamtrain27 9 yes it is•ÈÀ
Maybe it's the spooderman from the alternate reality.•ÈÀ
Literally the only good movie made by Sony Pictures Animation.•ÈÀ
Cycrostic Gayms cloudy with a chance of meatballs was decent•ÈÀ
"During the last comical skit in the trailer, the kid that the 6 spider people were trying to avoid, was reading a Spider-Man comic that happened to have Man-Spider and Julia Carpenter on the cover and weirdly enough had to have the classic Marvel logo on the cover•ÈÀ"
That shot at 2:28 looks very reminiscent of the black panther poster. Intentional or not?•ÈÀ
So much chills throughout the whole trailer•ÈÀ
Man I thought this was the real spider-man•ÈÀ
1:37 Who's she?•ÈÀ
Not dissin'! Just sayin'.•ÈÀ
Sebastian Vazquez the mecha spiderman•ÈÀ
@szeax not the robot. The little animÌ© girl.•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker. Her superhero name is ""SP//dr"". She's a 14 year old Japanese girl who has a psychic link to the radioactive spider that bit her. She uses that to control that spider-mecha.•ÈÀ"
Sebastian Vazquez the anime girl is the robot•ÈÀ
"@James G oh, OK.•ÈÀ"
So whos that anime girl looking character? Should I know her?•ÈÀ
"Jonatan Luna she's the mecha spider man, or peni parker.•ÈÀ"

_Ù÷â_Ù÷â Man Said What Bipoler studio ? _Ù÷â Im Done•ÈÀ
"Okay now wait a minute, why are you assuming this will be one of the best animated movies ever? This is a 3 minute trailer, trailers tend to make movies look great. If anything you should be more interested in Sony‰Ûªs track record, like you said they don‰Ûªt tend to make very good movies, so I‰Ûªm more inclined to assume this will suck too. Don‰Ûªt get me wrong I‰Ûªd love for this to be awesome, but until I‰Ûªve seen it a trailer is just not enough to encourage me to look past the indiscretions of Sony‰Ûªs past.•ÈÀ"
Yeah... It's gonna be great•ÈÀ
"Hi, I know you didn‰Ûªt mean it like this, but bipolar is quite a serious mental illness, so please don‰Ûªt use it trivially.•ÈÀ"

@Haaris Qureshi you are bipolar•ÈÀ
Incorrect. I do not have a diagnosis of bipolar.•ÈÀ

"MildGonolini Read that I typed ‰ÛÏmaybe‰Û cause yeah I dont know for sure but just from seeing the animation present in all three trailers as well as art direction anc lighting and the unique for Spiderman film story premise it looks like its shaping up to be what I said it might. Theres so many great choices made here like how the individual characters subtlety or overtly are drawn different from looking like the same animation style, the shading making things pop and look like im actually looking at the pages of a comic book and seeing 2D attempting 3dimensions yet its not grating to the eyes but smooth and enjoyable.•ÈÀ"
It's so cool that this is #1 trending right now! This movie is gonna look beautiful! The animation looks really experimental and neat!•ÈÀ

"This movie is unnecessary. No hate to Spider-Man, it's just that you can have Lego Batman Movie with a motion picture Batman already out there. This doesn't seem like the right time at all to have an animated Spider-Man movie come out in between two years that will have a motion picture Spider-Man. Also knowing that the character, Miles Morales, is not even 10 years old since his comic book debut, it seems even more unnecessary to have him in a movie like this and tease him for a motion picture. Too soon and too wrong. Wrong? Wrong being the backstory is gonna be a bit more altered than it should even be. Yeah, since when did they ever get any superhero's origin story right on the big screen? Fine, but still, don't mess his origin story up with a spider-verse already. It looks really messy and I don't like it at all. The quality of Spider-Man movies have been going down since TASM 1 & 2 in my opinion. Homecoming was overrated and I wouldn't watch it twice. MCU's gonna mess up Peter Parker after 2019, and the MCU will go to crap afterwards, but not just because of Peter Parker's remaining life on screen in the MCU.•ÈÀ"
"S K E E T who said that this was related to Lego batman? And miles has been out long enough... And the movie is about the spiderverse, it's not just about miles. They don't have to build this up like the mcu.•ÈÀ"
"szeax   Sorry for the confusion. No, I didn't mean to say it's connected to Lego Batman. Well, if they don't provide an explanation to how the other Spiders got their powers, then I'd say it would need some sort of a build up. I'm only saying this because the general audience who mainly keep up with Marvel movies in general only know how Peter Parker got his powers.•ÈÀ"

"Best of you to assume I don't know much about animations, though, because the way you wrote it out makes it seem like you're trying to assert that you are much more knowledgable here (EDIT: And I do know some stuff about animations). Anyway, DC makes pretty good animations but, more often than not, their writing is an abomination of clichÌ©s to cater casuals into the mix (EDIT: and that's how they earn their money. DC was a good company in the past, but now they're just discount Hollywood.)Edit: But, I dunno, just sharing my thoughts passive-aggressively (more on the aggressive side).

Am I the only who completely loves the lineup they have for this movie? I hope they don't make Peni Parker too much of an anime character just for laughs. And I also hope that every character gets a cool moment and their backstories are at least referenced.•ÈÀ
Yea I agree. As long as they do it a bit and not go overboard with Spider-Ham and SP//dr then I will be completely ok with it. Too be honest I kinda like that they made Spider-Ham a Looney Tunes style character.•ÈÀ

Aeryk_Angst It‰Ûªs another one of those animations trying to fit in by making ‰ÛÏcool‰Û movies.•ÈÀ
@Derek Ray Vidana its just an animated Spider-Man movie. Animation was probably the best way to go with a crazy concept like this. Its supposed to look like a comic book. Its also to bring lesser known characters like Miles Morales and Spider-Gwen into the mainstream. It looks like a fun animated movie. What's so wrong about that?•ÈÀ
Aeryk_Angst The animation style (not the way they move but the art) is similar to that of the Emoji Movie and we all know Emoji Movie - Trash•ÈÀ
Derek Ray Vidana and what does that have to do with anything? So now things can't have remotely similar artstyles?•ÈÀ
@Derek Ray Vidana Idk what movie you saw but this looks literally nothing like the artstyle of The Emoji Movie. I know it was trash. But your using the Emoji movie as a means to downplay this movie for no reason.•ÈÀ
Your Deepest Of Fears Pretty much not if it‰Ûªs by the same company that made the Emoji movie.•ÈÀ
"Aeryk_Angst I‰Ûªm not saying it will be the worst movie in existence, but it doesn‰Ûªt look good for Sony if the art style is somewhat similar to the Emoji movie - They are the ones who created Emoji movie after all.•ÈÀ"

"I want to love it but spider-verse on the big screen may not be the best idea in the world. Spider-verse is popular because its insane creativity demonstrated in altering the same idea again and again and again. It's NOT a superhero-team up story. Those characters are different versions of the same concept. There is no dynamic and drama. But hey, that's like THE thing now look at MCU.Also after all these years I have 0 confidence in Sony animation's storytelling skills. Introducing Millis, Gwen and Spidernoir at once sounds like a disaster.•ÈÀ"

Spider noir yes!!!•ÈÀ
I guessing this is sort of an indirect sequel/spinoff to the early 2000's Spidey. Since some of the flashbacks Peter showed were events from those movies. It looks really interesting.•ÈÀ
"Pretty sure it‰Ûªs just references/shoutouts to the movies. This is a different, much older Peter Parker.•ÈÀ"

"@707th SMB Vigil That's the point of his character. He comes from a dimension where his Mary Jane is dead, and he's gotten a little too old to fight crime. Though the voice acting isn't great.•ÈÀ"
he has to be grown up so he can be a good mentor geez accept something new for a change....•ÈÀ

"Soldier_66 Given that Peni (SP//dr) is one of the six Spider-Heroes and her entire thing is that she's ""anime Spider-Girl""  you're gonna have to get used to putting up with a bit ""weaboo"" if you plan on discussing the movie with other people. And if you plan on watching the movie yourself for that matter.•ÈÀ"
@pisscake I dont see how she is an anime girl. I've read the spider verse comic and it had nothibg to do with anime. Also i'm considered a weaboo at times.•ÈÀ
I do see she she is animated as an anime character so i have successfully made myself look a little stupid.•ÈÀ

Can anybody tell me who that anime girl is supposed to be•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker, aka ""SP//dr"". She's a 14 year old who's got a psychic link to a radioactive spider and pilots a spider mecha.•ÈÀ"
"Peni Parker or Sp//dr, a 14 year old girl from an alternate universe where she fights crime in a spiderman mech suit. although in the comics she's not as anime-y as she is protrayed in this.•ÈÀ"

Peni Parker has been established since 2014•ÈÀ

"Alex Alarcon Do you have literally any reason that doesn't just involving writing the entire thing off as ""she's anime""? Some critique on her character, her design, or something? Like, if your complaint was that she clashes with the rest of the movie I could understand, but that's sort of undermined by the fact that Spider-Ham clashes way more but you're seemingly fine with that, not to mention that the fact that they clash is sort of the point in the first place. Don't get me wrong I get that this is your opinion and that's fine, I just find it odd.•ÈÀ"
James G I rly don‰Ûªt like the mech. I don‰Ûªt get how she‰Ûªs anime tho. Don‰Ûªt know where u got that from. And spider ham does his own thing  and is obviously a joke character. I mean at least he has his own powers.•ÈÀ
"""I don't get how she's anime"". Are you actually for real, or what?And Peni Parker (aka ""SP//dr"") has a psychic link to a radioactive spider. It's how she can pilot the mecha, so yes, she does have her own powers. They're just not the same kind as the others.•ÈÀ"
@Alex Alarcon that's completely fine I'm also not too fussed about it either.•ÈÀ
James G meh. I still don‰Ûªt like her. I don‰Ûªt rly count that as powers.•ÈÀ
James G btw anime is a cartoon that was made in japan. Yes this is has a cartoon style but still isn‰Ûªt a cartoon. So technically not anime.•ÈÀ
"Well not everyone's gonna like every character, so I don't care if you don't like her. Just don't undermine her or toss her idea out for no reason is what I'm saying. And ""anime"" is a Japanese style. She's made to be anime. Something doesn't need to be made in Japan to be anime in nature. Her entire gimmick in this movie is that that she's the ""anime one"" in the Spider crew. How do you not get this.•ÈÀ"

Again and again only Spider Man sardard•ÈÀ
It looks good but the fps is horrible•ÈÀ

If this becomes a game new Spiderman shattered dimensions (I forgot what the game is)•ÈÀ
issue 21: miles jumps of somthing else and yells Brookline.•ÈÀ
Me gusta pero la animacion no es tan fluida y eso puede ser un problema•ÈÀ
Music title please•ÈÀ
10k dislikes? Why lmao this looks amazing•ÈÀ
"for me personally, it was because of the shitty art style, trying to make it look ""comic book esq"" when it just looks shitty and horrible to look at•ÈÀ"
"@dakota .broom yes please think like this, instead of jumping to conclusions and saying they hate it cause there is a black guy in it.•ÈÀ"
well obviously anyone who disagrees with an opinion is racist•ÈÀ
Lol a black kid with a loving father you don't see that everyday _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
This looks soooo beautiful.•ÈÀ
of course it has a loli LOL•ÈÀ
You mean Peni parker•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm so hyped for this•ÈÀ
The lego batman movie of marvel•ÈÀ
"Oh no they put in spider pigI was going to watch this movie you know•ÈÀ"
"John Mulaney as spider-ham, I think is absolutely amazing!•ÈÀ"
"it's getting better and better, I love how they did Spider Gwen•ÈÀ"
Just imagine if they didn‰Ûªt show all this and all we knew about it was the first Trailer it would be the most amazing thing ever but now it‰Ûªs probably going to be Good but not great in my opinion•ÈÀ
Liking this comment will bring you absolutely nothing.•ÈÀ
This is the exact reason I liked it.•ÈÀ
i like nothing•ÈÀ
I am nothing.•ÈÀ
At least I got what I signed up for•ÈÀ

Lame........ Hard pass•ÈÀ
I really want that Spider-Man Christmas album.•ÈÀ

"Im sorry, but is it just me who doesn‰Ûªt like thisSpider-man is the original and onlyWhy is this something?I really don‰Ûªt like this sorry•ÈÀ"
Cool... don't watch it :)•ÈÀ
Then you wouldn‰Ûªt like the event comic that this movie is a super compressed adaptation of given that 1610 Miles and 616 Peter join an absolute army of multiversal spider heroes.•ÈÀ
It's made by Sony that's what pisses me off. Just give the rights to Marvel ffs•ÈÀ
"vibhu sharma Did you miss ""Spider-Man: Homecoming?""  Or was it so overhyped and boring that you forgot about it?•ÈÀ"
"Josh Sinclair That is very subjective, where even if Marvel made mediocre Spider-Man movie, you can‰Ûªt possibly say Sony‰Ûªs Amazing Spider-Man movies are better•ÈÀ"
no he's not the only spiderman since Miles Morales is in earth 616( Main Universe) and is also spiderman and has been for years•ÈÀ
@Josh Sinclair SMH was from Marvel dickhead not Sony. Now Venom is from Sony and it's probably going to suck as well.•ÈÀ
Then why did you act like Marvel still doesn't have Spider-Man?•ÈÀ
"Don't like it either, but hey we all have to be multicultural these days...•ÈÀ"
...is that spider-pig an actual simpsons reference??•ÈÀ
no.•ÈÀ
No. Spider-Ham is a character that first appeared in 1983 if anything Simpsons made an obscure Marvel reference.•ÈÀ
just looked him up. 'peter porker'. fuckin hilarious•ÈÀ
"Spider-Person 1: ""...And then I was bitten by a radioactive spider.""SP 2: ""I was chosen by a magical Spider spirit. But otherwise same.""SP 3...MANY: ""We too!""Spider-Ham: ""I was a cartoon spider and then I was bitten by a radioactive pig.""ALL SPs: ""Er... *awkward silence*""•ÈÀ"

Not really. This'll be great•ÈÀ
"Not enough diversity for me, easy boycott.•ÈÀ"
What you mean•ÈÀ
Less white•ÈÀ
"You know this initially struck me as obvious sarcasm but given how moronic SJW types can get nowadays...I sincerely hope that you're not honestly complaining that a movie which's main character is black, features two Spider-Women, including an Asian one, and which's tagline is that ""what makes you different makes you Spider-Man"" doesn't have enough diversity.•ÈÀ"
James G shoulda gone with your first instinct•ÈÀ
i HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN THIS WHY THE HELL AM I WATCHING•ÈÀ
Perhaps you‰Ûªre interested•ÈÀ

Daniel Jaek.•ÈÀ
If they dont somehow incorporate that meme with 2 spidermans pointing at each other this movie is a bust.•ÈÀ
if they do do it then it is a bust•ÈÀ
Either way one of you will be disappointed•ÈÀ
And I can't wait to see either of you dissapointed. Lol•ÈÀ

"I rented a review of the troops from the Red alert 2 universe, come in, you'll like it)•ÈÀ"
1:03 is that from legion??!!!omg•ÈÀ
animiation makes me feel the video is about to buffer•ÈÀ
Not a big fan of the VA for Miles. Everything else looks pretty good tho.•ÈÀ
"Last DLC for Spider-Man PS4 comes out in December iirc, same as the movie. How fucking cool would it be if the last DLC ends with sending the Insomniacverse Spider-Man into the film to join other Peter Parker, Miles. Etc?•ÈÀ"
The voice actors aren‰Ûªt that great•ÈÀ
I love her outfit so cute 1:25•ÈÀ
"I called it "" Spidermans ""•ÈÀ"
If it has spoderman I would be happy•ÈÀ
Is this supposed to be Tobey maguires Spider-Man•ÈÀ
Yeah•ÈÀ
The Shane Dawson series should be trending. I know YouTube trending page is rigged. They think they‰Ûªre so sly...•ÈÀ
This film looks great but I really want Spider Man 2099 in this film•ÈÀ
2:24 åÀNed? :v•ÈÀ
"Black Goku It‰Ûªs Ganke, where Ned from Homecoming was inspired by Ganke from Miles Morales Spider Man. Also, this version is new as he has glasses•ÈÀ"
@Hyun Dong Lee no! is a joke :v•ÈÀ
i so wish to watch this but there's no cinemas where i live :(•ÈÀ
"I mean, having Nick as Peter is weird, but this looks fun as hell.•ÈÀ"
Spider Man is heartless. He doesn't remember Gwen? Bruh you killed her with your web and mourn for her but you can't remember her? SMH spiderman•ÈÀ
Different universe.•ÈÀ
@MrAmazing79 which universe? It's implied that Spiderman is from the main universe•ÈÀ
Awesome trailer... We all will watch•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm glad they put in Tobey Maguire‰Ûªs Spider-Man :‰Ûª)•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªd love to see this happen to the Marvel and DC Universe.•ÈÀ
Was that king if it was what happened to him•ÈÀ
My god peni Parker is hard to look at compared to everyone else•ÈÀ
He's in his 40's lol•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm senile•ÈÀ

I don't like the purposefully low framerate.•ÈÀ
Mj and peter yeah•ÈÀ

2:30 Black Panther anyone?•ÈÀ
Black Panther at 1:52?•ÈÀ
Trafalgus Apple prowler•ÈÀ
"INeedALife Totally right•ÈÀ"
Definitely a homage to Black Panther•ÈÀ
Lion•ÈÀ
@Charles Baylor no it isn't dumbasd•ÈÀ
Nigga that's a lion•ÈÀ
Oh right because the black super hero standing on an animal statue is obviously black panther. smh.•ÈÀ
What•ÈÀ
One of the animators already tweeted that the scene where miles is on the statue is a nod to Tchalla in the black panther poster.•ÈÀ
A black spiderman oh yeah•ÈÀ
"Miles is Hispanic, not black.•ÈÀ"
Bruh•ÈÀ

Please like its my b day•ÈÀ
Don't care. Won't like•ÈÀ
Hey if I am not Wrong this is linked with the spider ps4 game as the small boy‰Ûªs  father also police officer•ÈÀ
"No it's not apart of the Spiderman PS4 story just because it's the same characters doesn't make it the same story, that's like saying the MCU's Spiderman is linked with Spiderman PS4, and it is the same character from Spiderman PS4 it is miles Morales and his father the police officer•ÈÀ"
This is actually looking pretty good•ÈÀ
He looks like BLACK PANTHER•ÈÀ
Just THWIP!!!!!•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm confused _Ù_á_ÙÈ‰Û‰ªâ•ü Y‰Ûªall gonna call that pig in the spider suit as spider man too?•ÈÀ
"Spider-Ham. But otherwise, yes. By the way (if they keep his origin from the comic) he is a SPIDER... just was bitten by a radioactive pig.•ÈÀ"
I swear to God if they dont let me buy this movie and it's only in theaters I'm gonna tear Sony to the ground.•ÈÀ
Cant decide if I wanna watch this•ÈÀ
This is the Spider-Man movie we didn't know we needed.•ÈÀ
"not gonna lie, I wasn't sold at first since the studio is the same as the one behind likes of the smurfs and the emoji movie but this looks really good•ÈÀ"
Didn‰Ûªt know Spider-Man was black _ÙÔÛ•ÈÀ
0:30 imagine how long that took to make•ÈÀ
"Theres a reason that Aunt May appears out of nowhere. in SpiderGwen's universe, she basically helps Gwen, like Terry and Bruce in Batman Beyond.•ÈÀ"

That's not how 3D animation works•ÈÀ

"@The Nintendo Boy Spider-Man PS4 was the spaghettiInfinity war was the meatballs for that spaghettiAnd Venom is the black and gooey spaghetti sauce•ÈÀ"

He never left.•ÈÀ
"Well, the movie isn't all about Peter. Its focus is Miles.•ÈÀ"
TNovix but the hype is on Peter Parker and maybe a bit on Spider Ham•ÈÀ
"Ash Ketchum That probably sounded so smart in your head. I'm talking about in film obviously, you numpty.•ÈÀ"
"TNovix Thus me saying ""Spider-Man is back"" and not ""Peter Parker is back"".•ÈÀ"
hi•ÈÀ
Bvvwie It's not really news anymore. Miles has been around and a fan favourite for a few years now.•ÈÀ
It's BeeRay I think he steals a lot more than our hearts•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
But does he feel so good?•ÈÀ
It's BeeRay ur an idiot its really getting annoying•ÈÀ
Cripple Jesus balck and gooy spaghetti sauce? Are u eating  poo with ur spaghetti ??•ÈÀ

Keyk Luna nah carnage and venom but I prefer carnage•ÈÀ
My g wearing jordan 1ns _ÙÔÎ_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
Why does peter look so old?•ÈÀ
Peter Parker from Spider-Man Noir is from 1933 lol that's why (1:35)•ÈÀ
Kai no I‰Ûªm talking about normal Peter he had a beard and looks 30-40 instead of teens.•ÈÀ
Because Peter Parker is a much older Parker than the other Parkers that exist in this multiverse of Parker universes that have Parkers.•ÈÀ
He hasn‰Ûªt shaved for two days.•ÈÀ
U gotta love they hunted Tobey Maguire•ÈÀ
WOW! THE FIRST BLACK SPIDERMAN MOVIE AND THEY HAD TO ADD A WHITE ONE TOO!?!?!? TRIGGERED•ÈÀ

If 70s Spider-Man doesn‰Ûªt make it in I‰Ûªm gonna be disappointed•ÈÀ
Can superheroes die? Thanks. Tired of the same old characters and stories I‰Ûªm surprised no one else is.•ÈÀ
Then you don't watch superhero movies too often.•ÈÀ
"They can. STAYING dead is another matter. That's an ability generally restricted to the less well know and/or new ones.Reading superhero comics is like being in an abusive relationship. You either buy into the giant franchises and be content of being served the same old (because the others will ""riot"" if anything changes even for a short while) FOREVER, or you remain on the fringes with the knowledge that you WILL BE HURT repeatedly, as your loves can and will be destroyed/killed off on a whim when it serves the A-list same old.•ÈÀ"
So wait... im not different?•ÈÀ
0:52 can anyone tell me what kingpin says here?•ÈÀ
"sounds like ""You know of this"" - maybe he's squeezing Miles for information, then the super-collider goes boom.•ÈÀ"

Spider ham is awesome•ÈÀ
AHHHH I AM SO EXCITED•ÈÀ

If you have played the ps4 spiderman . This movie kinda links to it. Cause miles get bit by the spider. And his dad is a police....•ÈÀ
"I am not human yea, they both incorporate his character from the comics.•ÈÀ"
but that comes from the comics tho not the ps4 game lol•ÈÀ
Oh i see now. Lol•ÈÀ
Im used to only the spiderman movies. I dont remember no one being bit by spider•ÈÀ
Kinda hate the animation. It sucks.•ÈÀ
It's intentional to give that comic book vibe.•ÈÀ
Still hate it. American animation always tries to make it kids oriented when in reality animation is for everybody. This is why I stick to watching japanese anime.•ÈÀ

anime one is Peni Parker and you don't have to watch the other spider-man movies cause it takes place in different universes•ÈÀ
Oh I thought they were just trying to pull in anime nerds to watch the movie•ÈÀ
"Wtf sony, kawaii anime spider person, I‰Ûªm so lost, it looks like spider man mixed with some space transport stuff on acid•ÈÀ"

no the anime dimension is the real one....we live in the less popular and more boring one where there are no fighting robots or super-powered beings that constantly fight and raise insurance premiums for cities after they are finished•ÈÀ
@Scott Mantooth Didn't Spiderman in Japan influence the creation of the Power rangers?•ÈÀ
Boo. Screw that world.•ÈÀ
There are at least 6-7 Japanese versions of spider man (all are cannon)•ÈÀ
Money the original Spider-verse story actually featured that Spider-Man•ÈÀ
"@Money the 1973 Spiderman series was made through a collaboration between Toei and Marvel. It included a giant robot called Leopardon. Marvel also collaborated on the third Super Sentai series (the first two were technically originally Sentai, as they had no giant robots), Battle Fever J - the first Super Sentai series to feature giant robots. Power Rangers uses footage from Super Sentai (the original series used footage from Zyuranger). So yes, Spiderman is basically the reason that the Power Rangers use giant robots.•ÈÀ"
"There are several actually. There's at least 5 Marvel character's anime that I know of. Many more out there probably.There is also a Mangaverse, which is straight up Marvel comics in manga style.Though Peni is originally not actually anime/manga. She's a character that carries influences from anime, like Big Hero 6. They just made an anime styled version of her for the movie.•ÈÀ"

Spider Pig•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm confused as hell. So miles morales is the spiderman in the ultimate universe. So why is peter Parker teaching miles like he hasn‰Ûªt been spiderman. At first I thought miles had powers he just didn‰Ûªt know and peter helped him learn how to use them. But from this trailer we gather spiderman (miles) is well known from his dad ranting about spiderman. This means he is already spiderman and fighting crime. So why later is peter ‰ÛÏtraining‰Û miles to simply web swing in a shitty costume? It can‰Ûªt be that officer davis is complaining about peter spiderman because we already know peter is from a different universe and that miles is the spiderman in their universe•ÈÀ
Great video this trailer is amazing and it looks fun to watch.•ÈÀ
Why is Gwen Stacy a bull Dyke•ÈÀ
Is it just me or does Miles' dad sound like Vin Diesel?•ÈÀ

"I will admit, I'm a bit hesitant on this. The Angry Birds movie and Emoji Movie don't inspire any confidence, but I hope that this works out. Although, I'm not going to lie, the main thing that this has going for it, from my standpoint, is the fact that its going to be the first movie in a long time, if ever, (that I can remember), that combines 2d and 3d throughout the film, and unlike other movies, like the Coco opening paper animation and Maui's tattoo, has the 2d animation styled characters be their own. The Coco opening's 2d was used to tell a story, but not their own characters, and while Maui's tattoo, you could argue, was its own character, I think of it as an extension of Maui's. Just wanted to make it clear. But I must say, I really think that going with that design choice is what is going to make Anime-Spider-Mech (Peni Parker) and Spider-Ham (Peter Porker) work. Using anime style for Peni Parker and cartoon style for Spider-Ham were excellent choices that represent each character exceptionally. I won't pretend that I know anything about Peni other than her name (and the fact that she was based on anime), but Spider-Ham as a cartoon was probably one of the best design choices in this movie. I just hope that they still apply cartoon physics to some extent. Using different styles for different types of universes, (Spider-Man Noir is slightly different from the other three 3d characters) is an interesting and creative design choice.TLDR: I'm both excited and worried about this movie. Sony could mess it up bad, I'm not ruling that out, but it isn't looking like this company will. The story, while seeming somewhat simple, will allow the many characters (Spider-Man OG, Spider-Man Miles, Spider-Girl Gwen, Spider-Girl Anime, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham, and still crossing my fingers for Spider-Man 2099) to develop and, arguably more importantly, interact. I've got my hopes up for this movie. Sony, if you mess this (and Venom) up, prepare to get destroyed by the internet.•ÈÀ"
"Angry birds was a good movie and emoji movie gets too much hate even though it is pretty bad, plus the trailer for this is way more promising than the trailers for the other movies•ÈÀ"

"Ugh cant even get gwen's hair right. All these excited comments and no ones noticing how out of place some of this seems, the style of paper book animation with the computer stop motion type style just dont match that well. Specifically shown in the fall scene with the two swinging. This is also the only movie having Peter Parker being an adult compared to the live action marvel timelines having it being hi begining. I do like the idea it's just going to throw off the timeline because obviously this will 9/10 get a second installment. The styles being mixed was a cute idea at first but in some places just doesn't work, and by this I mean having some characters look more cartoony than 3 block like models. Yes I enjoy Spider-Man, yes I enjoy the multi-verse, but dear lord could we have made some of the scenes way more appealing.•ÈÀ"

the opening song happen at the end of the movie of a pg13 movie call central intelligence•ÈÀ
You can get the popsicle at a ice cream truck•ÈÀ
SuperGaming Dude bruh that polsicle nasty af•ÈÀ
"I know, but we don't have right now!•ÈÀ"

SuperGaming Dude You can get it in New York!•ÈÀ
"Everyone says the popsicle is bad after they made a joke about it. They didn‰Ûªt even say t was bad they said it was ‰ÛÏso-so‰Û. It‰Ûªs not bad, it‰Ûªs alright•ÈÀ"
SuperGaming Dude medhi•ÈÀ
That popsicle is real. It's not great.•ÈÀ
"SuperGaming Dude come to New York but you will have to wait until summer, because that‰Ûªs when the ice cream truck comes :)•ÈÀ"
robertito5978 I saw the ice cream truck a few blocks from my school the other day lol but I think that‰Ûªs about the last time I‰Ûªll see one until next summer•ÈÀ
That raggedy homeless popcyle•ÈÀ
The popsicle is at the ice cream truck or the ice cream man at the streetcars•ÈÀ
thats a copy•ÈÀ
IM HYPED UP ‰_•ü‰_•ü‰_•ü•ÈÀ
This hilarious•ÈÀ
_Ù÷Î_Ù÷Î_Ù÷Î_Ù÷Î_Ù÷Î_Ù÷Î_Ù÷Î•ÈÀ
i want to see that so freaking much !!!!!•ÈÀ
They should make one Chinese and an Arab version to...•ÈÀ
the popsicle = #1  O N  T R E N D I N G•ÈÀ
I hope they‰Ûªve put Spider-Man 2099•ÈÀ
I swear spider man is only 17•ÈÀ
Brite Bomber I have a feeling you‰Ûªve only read one comic in your life.•ÈÀ
Donald Glover should‰Ûªve been miles in this movie. But this looks really good though.•ÈÀ
that would be kinda odd considering Donald Glover had a cameo as Miles's uncle int eh Spider-Man: Homecoming film.•ÈÀ
"the cartoonist this movie looks like it has nothing to do with the mcu. Mile‰Ûªs uncle is already in this movie as another actor. Donald voiced miles in the ultimate spiderman cartoon, so I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªd be too odd.•ÈÀ"
"oh, ok. i didn't know about the ultimate spider-man cartoon.•ÈÀ"
Wow this animated spider man movie best ever blasting the old animation records I think ....•ÈÀ
Easter egg @ 1:38•ÈÀ
Spiderman is black now? Is Batman gonna be Asian or Mexican in the next movie?•ÈÀ
You're so dumb. Miles Morales is Spider-Man for a long time now•ÈÀ
"You ask yourself why is he black?Because no one should be a outsider (we are not racist/sexist right guys?!!) The next spiderman is a woman or disabled orr a disabled woman•ÈÀ"
1:37 OMG it's Spider-Chan•ÈÀ
Bored•ÈÀ
This looks so dumb•ÈÀ
Jorge Gonzales Nope. Sorry you‰Ûªre not an actual fan.•ÈÀ
"@Benjamin Ruggles Um, that's why I said it looks dumb. Because to be a fan would mean that I enjoy it, and I don't. Glad we're in agreement.•ÈÀ"
pizza theme intensifies•ÈÀ
spidermans.... black now. just like star fire from teen titans. one of the ghost busters from the new one. what is it with changing characters for social brownie points? theyrd be an outrage if a black character got changed white.•ÈÀ
Poles only miles is black•ÈÀ
did you watch the trailer??????•ÈÀ
Poles Starfire is an alien. There is no correct ethnicity for her. Miles has existed for years. Jesus man do your research.•ÈÀ
sPIDER PIG•ÈÀ
Spider man in air forces•ÈÀ
the animation is lagging or what ?•ÈÀ
Which background music is this?•ÈÀ
This looks so stupid•ÈÀ
joe chaz Nope. Guess you‰Ûªre not a superhero person.•ÈÀ
Where‰Ûªs the pile of dust for MCU spidey•ÈÀ
I'm still pissed that they took Solo away from Lord and Miller and I just want this movie to do so well to show that Disney was wrong.•ÈÀ
"Yeah, I‰Ûªm fine with just Peter Parker.•ÈÀ"
Robert Targaryen Guess you‰Ûªre not an actual fan otherwise you‰Ûªd know these guys have been around a while.•ÈÀ
"You guessed right, im not an actual fan, that would be a device that moves air.•ÈÀ"
Robert Targaryen Almost stuck the landing with that one. Good try though.•ÈÀ
Where's Spider-cop?!•ÈÀ
Noir awesome!•ÈÀ
We are the venom•ÈÀ
SPIDER PIG SPIDER PIG DOES WHATEVER A SPIDER PIG DOES•ÈÀ
I love it ‰_•ÈÀ
Dad I love you _ÙÔÎ•ÈÀ
"This is what you call a spiderman movie, not that spiderman homecoming crap, that's in no real connection with the comics. Full of jokes, and seems like a captain america in a suit of powers. I love how this film links with the spiderverse and all of that.•ÈÀ"
"Imagine a live action spider verse story, which follows the comics (with Morlun and the other spider hunters) that would be so awesome. Still pumped for this movie!•ÈÀ"
Itd be funny if they were seeing all the Spider-Men that arrived and then a bunch of dust just arrived•ÈÀ

the art style is amazing!•ÈÀ
Why so many dislikes on such a sweet piece of art?•ÈÀ
"Whether it's good or bad or somewhere inbetween, the alt-right is traumatized whenever a movie doesn't just revolve around a white guy.•ÈÀ"
One word: Opinions.•ÈÀ
DejaVoodooDoll nice straw man•ÈÀ
"@Eric AlveloDon't ever lose that innocence.•ÈÀ"
DejaVoodooDoll That has nothing to do with innocence. One of the main characters is clearly a white guy.•ÈÀ
"He said Alt-right, not ""the Right"". If you don't think the Alt-right is racist then you're out of your little mind.•ÈÀ"
Sovereign DC Doesnt really make a difference. This is the first thread to ever bring race into this•ÈÀ
"Sovereign DC Oof, I forgot what the extreme right stands for•ÈÀ"
Born of Fire lmfao i love this thread•ÈÀ
Born of Fire i literally couldn‰Ûªt give two shits about his race it‰Ûªs all about the characterization•ÈÀ
selektMike Sony•ÈÀ
"@Born of FireAll the incel sites lean more towards your politics, when they're not pretending to be nice guys, so don't talk trash about your friends. But thanks for providing a demonstration of that famous alt right racism I mentioned earlier.•ÈÀ"
"@DejaVoodooDoll yeah, the problem with that theory is that there are more dislikes now than there are alt-right. Multiple accounts, I suppose, but who's really that petty, eh? Personally, I'm not a fan of low frame character animations. The jerky way they more irritates me. If it wasn't for the fact that I really like the Miles Spider-Man, and having a whole bunch of different spiders all in one place is so amusing, I would likely have disliked it. Instead, I'll neither like, nor dislike.•ÈÀ"
"Well, to find out, let's play ""Spot The Hater!""•ÈÀ"
@Born of Fire Found him. That didn't take long.•ÈÀ
DejaVoodooDoll u pulled the race card a little to fast•ÈÀ
"Lmao why did you make it political, some people just don't like Spider-man y'know...•ÈÀ"
-Lord where have you been then? I‰Ûªve seen it on every trailer thread.•ÈÀ
"@Ryan GunnIf you think there's less than 9 thousand alt-righters out there, you ought to check the viewcounts on their videos. Or look at how many politicians are kissing their asses. But kudos for not being one of them. The frame rate's fair criticism. Personally, I don't mind it, if it means each frame looks this good.•ÈÀ"
DejaVoodooDoll Look a leftist playing the race card. Shocker!•ÈÀ
Because there was an anime girl in there and the main protagonist is a black male that looks like he's 13 and is friends with an adult that is teaching him how to become Spiderman without his own parents permission.•ÈÀ
angelduck 16 Pretty shitty ones at best if we‰Ûªre being honest here.•ÈÀ
This art style is amazing with the booms and thwips•ÈÀ
Like pause at 2:06 look at that background•ÈÀ
Lucas 7777 he is 13 or 14•ÈÀ
"DejaVoodooDoll actually, it's probably because the director supports a domestic terrorist organization.  I'm not even a fan of Marvel, I just wanted to check out the comments.  LOL•ÈÀ"
"@Three60CrusaderOh, right. I forgot, racism ceased to exist the moment America elected Obama president. Also, sexism. I'm still not sure how the world solved those problems, but it was probably due to social media and X-Box Live.•ÈÀ"
Because a lot of people are biased against Sony's Spider-Man movies•ÈÀ
DejaVoodooDoll i have nothing against black people and i want racist people to jump out of a window but maybe people dont want him to change•ÈÀ
the racist•ÈÀ
"@CRAZY GAMERAt least it's not One More Day or the Clone Saga.•ÈÀ"
"@DejaVoodooDoll without ""white guys"" you wouldn't be enjoying the Internet right now and this shitty little movie wouldn't even exist.•ÈÀ"
@DejaVoodooDoll lmao another Race baiter.•ÈÀ

"Marco Trapoja without native Americans, Asians and Africans it wouldn‰Ûªt exist either. What‰Ûªs your point? If you think someone is race baiting its dumb to use race as an argument for a response especially when you make yourself look stupid.•ÈÀ"
DejaVoodooDoll and we found the politics addict•ÈÀ
DejaVoodooDoll I mean same logic can be applied to the left. They disliked it because it has too many white Spider heroes.•ÈÀ
selektMike Racists mad about a black Spider-man.•ÈÀ
Because he's black•ÈÀ
hi•ÈÀ
And you're traumatized that nothing ever revolve around blacks.•ÈÀ

And Spider-Ham/Peter Porker has been around for decades. Like it or not this is all part of Spider-Man canon, so I'm afraid you're gonna have to deal with it. I get that a lot of people don't follow the comic canon so this'll seem outta nowhere to them, but this is based on the comics. Which, you know, is the actual original canon.•ÈÀ"

"The fps is hurting me, because the art style and animation looks so good•ÈÀ"
It's a stylistic choice to make it look more like a comic book. Not every single thing has to be crystal clear 10 trillion frames a second•ÈÀ
It doesn't make it look more like a comic book though. It just makes it not look as good. Other than that everything looks great•ÈÀ
@KADE HOLMAN but it does though. Its a technique also used with the lego movie where there are so little inbetween frames that every frame looks like a key one. You can pretty much take out any shot and it looks good lol•ÈÀ
"@Das It Mane yeah, but 25 would be nice. Even 20.•ÈÀ"
Yeah. It's the same thing for Dragon Ball FighterZ. I don't understand why people think that low frame-rate animation is ever a good artistic choice. It's just painful to look at.•ÈÀ
Cripple Jesus really I never noticed it in FighterZ though. Do you mean when the characters do their ults or just in general?•ÈÀ
"The characters are shaded like comic book characters (just look at Spider-Man Noir's design) and this more limited jolty movement is a very clear stylistic choice. It's not that it ""looks good"" or ""looks better"" without the higher frame rate, but it's so that the movie has a style. Also, if you're saying that the animation looks good, you're saying the fps looks good.•ÈÀ"

Why the hell are you watching this trailer then? Being white is not a big part of Spider-Man's character. He's a teen who has been bitten by a radioactive spider and learns to use his powers responsibly. It's just a movie and Peter is in the movie. Did you even watched the trailer?•ÈÀ
"Do you have a problem with gay and Transgender people? I'm not an SJW, but I do want to know.•ÈÀ"
"@Stupid Firefly coz I had no idea what this trailer was about before I watched it, right? Ok there is a teenager with a spider bite and super powers, why on earth do we need an exact black copy?? Same idea, same problems, same abilities but... black. Imo this is just a stupid tendency to be tolerant. If you're saying that being black is not a part of spider man's personality then why reinventing the wheel?•ÈÀ"

For some reason this movie runs at 15 frames per second. It's so lanky and twitchy it's insane... I am so dissapointed by the looks of it and the animations are off too. The plot seems to be terrible and overused with 0 real stakes in the play or room for character development and the voice acting is lacking. Spider-man PS4's cutscenes would make a better movie. Althought I will reserve final judgement after I watch the movie. For now it's a generous 4/10•ÈÀ

@TK-421 did Maguire effortlessly fight half of the avengers besides cap and win? No. Did Maguire figure out how to beat giant man almost instantly? No. Did Maguire fight thanos and almost win? No•ÈÀ
@TK-421 Maguire beat his enemies either because they were stupid or they turned good. And they all died. Tom Holland's spiderman beat vulture and saved him from dying. Has Maguire done the same? No•ÈÀ
"Really? Teary mcguire,  emo mcguire , cringy dancing mcguire? That one?•ÈÀ"
"@Prince Darwin Did Tom stop a train himself? No, did Tom got ravaged to the point of almost dying and still beat Green Goblin? No, did Tom fight Venom AND Sandman at the same time? No, and Tom was not even alone, he had the freaking Avengers at his side, Tobey was alone.•ÈÀ"
Is Tobey a whiny Iron Man Jr.? No•ÈÀ
@Colonel Mustard correction. Harry fought sand man. Toby got whooped by both sand man and venom. And he basically let gob beat him up. He only won because he jumped over a glider that killed gob. And Tom fought 4 or 5 avengers by himself (he took bucky and falcon on at once) and won against 3-4 by himself besides giant man which hes did most of the work. Toby would've gotten beaten up bad and would've needed help like always. And redirecting a plane so it doesnt cause another 9/11 is more impressive than stopping a train. And btw hes responsible for saving doctor strange and beating ebony maw•ÈÀ
@Tricko toby is really whiny. I bet you if you add up all his crying scenes and put it all i none movie it would take up 10-15 percent of the time•ÈÀ
"@Prince Darwin Goblin didn't beat Sandman lol. Help like always? That was the first and last time he had a partner. No way an airplane is more impressive than a train. A train has tons of people, besides its multiple carts...Tom is just Ironman's cocksucker. And you disguise the situation. Dr. Octopus died because he drowned the machine and was the only way to stop it, if not, the city would be destroyed. In Homecoming there was zero chance the city would be in danger. Tobey a crybaby? Dude, he indirectly ""killed"" his best friend's father, and later, he lost that same friend in the same way his father passed away. Crying makes him a crybaby? Let's see if you don't cry if a psychopath kills your mother. Tom has not seen anyone dying except for Uncle Ben.•ÈÀ"
"@Colonel Mustard yes. Harry is the one that beat sandman. Not spiderman. He also needed his help fighting venom. And (flashback) spiderman was helped by an inanimate object in the norman fight. HE DID BARLEY ANY OF THE WORK IN ANY OF THE MOVIES WHILE FIGHTING THE MAIN VILLANS And think about this. The train if he didnt stop it would go into the water killing only the people inside the train. So maybe a couple hundred . If tom didn't redirect the plane it would crash into a bunch of tall buildings killing thousands. more deaths Than (like i said) 9/11 itself. And doc ock counts because he turned good and key word HELPED Toby save the city. And if dock was still bad toby would sacrifice himself. hed DIE. And then who would protect new york? Also If that doesn't happen the building wouldve dropped on ock or something and it would kill him and probably would drown the thing anyway. Again. Making pete do barley anything. Tom had to STRUGGLE. HE HAD A BIG CONCRETE BUILDING FALL ON TOP OF HIM. HE HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF IT. and another thing he had to STRUGGLE to fight vulture. And he barley won. And guess what? He saved him from dying. Unlike toby. And sand man didn't die because he basically cant die. Oh and another thing. He lost his girlfriend. Mary jane did nothing but be a living trash can. And she still got with toby. He basically gets everything handed to him. The only bad thing that happen to him are 1. Ben dies. And 2. Harry dies. Lets see what tom went through. Uncle ben died. He gets bullied constantly. He almost gets drowned. His friends almost die. He almost dies again. His favorite sandwitch place gets blown up. He kinda fails saving the ferry. Almost dies again.  And barley wins against vulture. And doesn't get with the girl. And in infinity war he goes into space to help save THE UNIVERSE. almost dies twice. Fights thanos and almost wins. But loses. Gets punched with giant fists. And loses. Again. Then he ""dies"" trying to protect the universe.. What has toby been doing? You can sit down now. And shut up•ÈÀ"
"Prince Darwin he didn‰Ûªt fight avengers alone, he didn‰Ûªt fight thanos alone, he didn‰Ûªt even fight with vulture his wings were just exploded itself•ÈÀ"
"@TK-421 not in civil war. He fought cap, sam, and bucky all by himself. He had iron man and war machines help with giant man. But he did most of the work there. In IW yeah He had help. ITS THANOS. you are an ignorant biased imbecile if you think tobys spiderman could beat thanos by himself. Another thing. Toms spiderman fought almost all his battles by himself. Toby always had help whether it be a friend or by the villan itself. And in iw its pete helping them. Same with cw. But he had people help him once and thats it. In spiderman 1. Goblin beats up tobys pete bloody. And a minute later he kills himself. Spiderman 2. Ock beats up pete, turns good and kills himself. Spiderman 3.   Sand man and venom savagely demolishes pete. Harry beats sand castle. And helps helps fight Venom. Gets killed. Then pete plays bad music and kills venom and eddie. He does barely anything in those fights. With hardly any effort. Also. Just another thing. Tobys spiderman straight up murders people. He lets so many people die its unreal. Now are you gonna open your biased and ignorant mouth again and make me call you out for being stupid? Or are you gonna wise up and accept that cry baby emo parker isnt as great if a spiderman as you think?•ÈÀ"
"@Prince Darwin Seriously? Goblin turned his glider but Peter jumped and stabbed Norman instead, he DIDN'T kill himself because he wanted. With Ock he fought hard and did beat Otto in a fair battle, THEN he decides to end his life. And with Venom, Goblin did JACKSHIT. Harry threw Razor Bats at him but Venom absorbed them. Then he tries to stab him with his glider but he pushes him, causing his sacrifice. After that Peter fights in a 1 on 1 with Venom and beats him. Thanos, ha ha, Thanos vs Venom? I don't know, Venom can eat an entire person as shown in different comics, and can change his size, so he could eat Thanos' brain easily if he doesn't have the gauntlet. Talking about Thanos, Peter AND Ironman were taking off the gauntlet, Peter did nothing on his own. He didn't suffer at all, and if you say the ""I don't feel so good"" argument, well, Tobey Spidey was bleeding off both with Goblin and Venom, Sandman was crushing his skull and yet he holded on. And you didn't reply to my question, åÀwhy is Peter a ""crybaby""?•ÈÀ"
@Colonel Mustard you need to go back to school. I cant understand a word you are saying•ÈÀ
"@Prince Darwin So now you are attacking me because I don't have good grammar? I'm pretty sure even a donkey can understand my statement. And in the extreme case I commited grammar errors, oh, God, sorry grammar officer, you changed my life, but I'm afraid you can't do jackshit about it because I'm chilean and english is not my first language.•ÈÀ"
let me just recap here. Read carefully. I said if you think |||||TOBYS SPIDERMAN||||| can fight thanos by himself you are biased and ignorant. And thanos would lay the floor with venom. He would crush him and erase him from existence. And did i say goblin killed himself willfully? No. I just said he killed himself. After he almost laid the floor with pete. And toms spiderman did suffer. He suffered through a lot in one movie. He almost died by drowning. He almost died by a giant lazer. All of His friends almost died. He saved thousands of people from a plane crash and survived said plane crash. He had a big building made of cement fall on top of him. And what happened after that? He pulled through and fought vulture and almost died. And he knew he was probably gonna die. But guess what? He kept pushing through with nothing but one of his web shooters. And after the fact he lost his love interest. You cannot say he has not struggled because that would be a lie. And yes. Tobys apiderman cries all the time. The only times he should've cried is when uncle ben and harry died. Thats it. Not every other second.  The only time tom cried is when a concrete building fell on top of him. And he had to find himself so he could muster up the courage to lift the building off of him. And harry did most of the heavy lifting in spiderman 3. HE was the one who beat sandman. HES the one who saved pete from them twice. If it werent for him pete would be dead. twice in the span of 3 or so minutes. He wouldve lost and died if harry didnt show up•ÈÀ
@Colonel Mustard and the ock fight in s2 the way he won was mediocre at best. All he dud was repeatedly punch him in the face and electrocuted him. Thats all he did. That was hardly a fight•ÈÀ
"@Prince Darwin That demonstrates Tobey Spidey has a brain and KNOWS how to use it. And I was talking about Venom eating Thanos without gauntlet, and Spidey did beat Venom, so you know the rest.•ÈÀ"
"@Prince Darwin Oh and you said Tom Spidey suffered because his friends ALMOST DIED, well I've got news, Tobey Spider-Man actually lost friends, like Harry, and in SM3 he knows the truth about his Uncle Ben which torments him through the full movie.•ÈÀ"

"Ok people stay with me here cause I‰Ûªm gonna explain this to everyone who doesn‰Ûªt read the comics. (I don‰Ûªt  read the comics that much too, I just saw Ultimate Spider-Man, so any real comic fan who would like to help me get the facts right would be greatly appreciated) First: the spider-verse has been a thing for years. Second: the spider-verse is filled with many different iterations of the Spider-Man timeline. There is: Miles Morales (a black kid who got bit by the radioactive spider instead of Peter. He goes by the superhero name Spider-Man. Then we have Gwen Stacy who I think goes by the superhero name SpiderGwen. That is all I have for now. I could really need some help from people who actually reads the comics. Thanks in advance.•ÈÀ"
Princess Derpy of the muffin empire. Actually. It wasn‰Ûªt instead of Peter. They both got bit by a radioactive spider and Peter died so Miles took up the name Spider Man•ÈÀ
Princess Derpy of the muffin empire. There‰Ûªs a LOT of alternate Spider-Man characters. It would take a long time to list them all.•ÈÀ
BlockSquad1000 just the ones in this trailer.•ÈÀ
"If I remember correctly,  Spider-Gwen was based off of a what if book where Gwen got bit by the radioactive spider instead of Peter. I remember this because my sister told me and bought the book.•ÈÀ"
"Princess Derpy of the muffin empire. Oh, okay. Well, you already know Miles and Gwen, but there‰Ûªs also Spider-Ham (Who is from an alternate universe where the Marvel characters are all animals), Spider-Man Noir (From a universe that is set in the 1930s) and Sp//dr who is from an anime-inspired world (She controls a giant Spider-mech).•ÈÀ"
"@Terr!f!c Legend Peter didn't die, he's like the Green Goblin, the Oz thingy doesn't let them die.•ÈÀ"
Miles became spiderman after Peter died. Also spider gwen's comic is called spider gwen but really she's just a version of spider woman•ÈÀ
Thank you guys. I'm sure this will help non comic book fans understand.•ÈÀ
@BlockSquad1000 I watched ultimate Spiderman so I know about Spider-Ham but didn't know anything else than the fact that he exists.•ÈÀ
Wait... why don't peter recognize Gwen though?•ÈÀ
Because they're from different universes.•ÈÀ
"Well, yeah but if that peter supposed to be the OG spidey then Gwen should be in that universe as well (well, ""had been"" cuz you know). Or maybe it's just a different peter entirely or better yet he is Raimi's spiderman! lol! I mean they showed that train scene and car wreck in the cafe scene in this trailer.

"You know I always found the idea of our good old Petey having lil' sises to be rather cool, hilarious, and cute all at the same time. I don't know it just seems right.•ÈÀ"
"It's just too bad that Peni is technically only his adopted cousin, if we follow her official comic series' storyline.No really, look it up in the official Marvel wiki under Peni Parker, it will show Ben and May Parker as her adopted parents.•ÈÀ"
"Also to answer your question. I think it was to give her character some personality and edge.Trust me, I initially felt like they should have brought in the Marvel Mangaverse Peter Parker, who is like a Ninja Spider-Man with actual ninja equipment and a Ninja Clan. But the I also noticed that there are already 3 version of him. Regular Peter Parker, Noir Peter Parker, and Peter Porker. So yeah I think we have enough and could have other more unique iterations rather then just old Peter. Having Peni and giving her the anime makeover is an actual legitimately good compromise. Let's hope the movie will turn out okay.•ÈÀ"
Pretty sure they did it for comedy.•ÈÀ

It is. Insomniac made the suit.•ÈÀ

Wow! Awesome detail. I really like the design of the suit.•ÈÀ
@Prince Darwin I wasn't sure 100% that's all ;) And I wasn't sure that was exactly the insomniac one•ÈÀ
@Malaska :D you dont need to be a 'die hard fanboy' to know that. Put thought and logic into your thoughts. Everyone has been talking about this since the beginning of development. All you need yo do is look up one video•ÈÀ

I didn't even notice Aunt May until this comment :D•ÈÀ
Prince Darwin Your argument is nothing but hypothetical what ifs and digs at someone with a completely reasonable question. Not everyone is going to know that the main suit on the new Spider-Man game is an insomniac original.•ÈÀ
@PeytonsTheName my argument is anyything but hypothetical. The other guys is. Anyone who goes on the internet and anyone who is a spiderman fan in the slightest knows what spiderman ps4 is. I have had about 20+ ads about it in one day without watching anything spiderman related. Another thing. If you watch anything spiderman related or look up spiderman you will definitely see spiderman ps4.•ÈÀ
"Yea bruh, i love spider man and none of my friends do, im absolutely certain they know nothing about the game•ÈÀ"
@PeytonsTheName and think about this. If something has never been seen or talked about before except in something new. And theres a lot of talk about this thing being new. Its probably new•ÈÀ

@vino aja Tom Holland sucks. Ultimate Spiderman sucks•ÈÀ
@Michael Hazell Oh you're lying lol•ÈÀ
The game was fucked up when miles became Spider-Man in the same universe as Peter Parker•ÈÀ
@Mr. Woods no amazing Spider-Man is best Spider-Man. Ultimate Spiderman is a joke•ÈÀ
@Michael Hazell Oh you are an idiot. You never read Ultimate Spider-Man have you? It's beautifully written and it actually kills Peter Parker. So...Yeah Ultimate Spider-Man isn't as convoluted or as confusing as The Amazing Spider-Man. I love all Spider-Man related things but put some respect on Ultimate comics•ÈÀ
"@Mr. Woods I am an idiot for disliking a less intelligent, less skilled, and fanboy Spider-Man? I grew on the amazing Spider-Man, I hate ultimate Spiderman. Ultimate Spiderman ruins Peter Parkers character and the general atmosphere of Queens just like Frank Miller killed bats and supes.•ÈÀ"
Ultimate Spiderman is just a depressive and boring iteration of Spider-Man•ÈÀ
Seems like Thanos been killing him•ÈÀ
"@Michael Hazell ... Okay dude. Okay. I want to respect your opinion but Ultimate Spider-Man has the drama, the villains and the story to drive it forward. They really emphasize the fact that this is an inexperienced kid trying to save the world. It's regarded as the greatest interpretation of the character because it's so emotional. If you can't realize that then you should read it over and then note how Ultimate Spider-Man had an impact on how to portray the character from that point on•ÈÀ"
@Michael Hazell I grew up on The Amazing Spider-Man too but that doesn't mean Ultimate isn't good because it's different•ÈÀ
"@Mr. Woods you are right it isn't good, it's crap. I don't have time to read an emotional unstable peter•ÈÀ"
@Michael Hazell But he's a kid...that makes him realistic and a good character. Haven't you read Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man? When Spider-Man died? Or when Aunt Was shot?•ÈÀ
Don‰Ûªt forget Venom and PS4 Spider-Man. They are killing it.•ÈÀ
Tom Holland really sucks. Yuri Lowenthal and John Bubniak are the Best (as Peter)  New Miles Morales are also better than Holland.•ÈÀ

"I like Peni Parker and I really like this art style for her I think it fits with her role here even though it's different to her comic appearance. That being said, the Bowsette meme is freaking moronic and anyone partaking in it deserves nothing but a slow and painful death.•ÈÀ"
James G You're right dude Booette is the way to go.•ÈÀ
"DÌ¦rmarochi More like Toadette--Oh wait.In all seriousness though, it's fine as a joke and all that, but it's the people who take it the next level that make me wanna stab people. When I see people posting highly detailed BDSM fetish art featuring a gender-swapped sexy version of a turtle villain from a children's video game series to sites like Sankaku Complex it sorta makes me worry about the sanity of the people drawing it. Which I have seen. Numerous times, while just casually looking for other stuff.Don't ask me why I'm even on those sites in the first place.•ÈÀ"
James G why are u on those sites in the first place?•ÈÀ
DÌ¦rmarochi love booette more then bowsette I want her and a luigi romance fanfic somewhere•ÈÀ

It's not to replace white epople calm down if it was they wouldn't have put in Gwen and the three Peter parkers•ÈÀ
"Lol black spiderman. Whats next, native-american hercules?•ÈÀ"
Black Spiderman has been a thing for a long while•ÈÀ
and its wrong•ÈÀ
@Bubble Double why because diversity is. Bad and everyone should. Just be white•ÈÀ
"@Devin Smithwick im not being racist it's just that you dont have to make a character in every race. Like it just ruins it and the plot, like sure make some other black hero (there already are dozens) but not ruin an already white character.•ÈÀ"
"@Bubble Double well when u add diversity more people want to watch it and it makes more money, it's not like their replacing spider Man, and most of these people have been around for years so this is nothing new•ÈÀ"
@Devin Smithwick Just cause its not new doesn't make it not bad.•ÈÀ
@Bubble Double alright at this point it's clear to my that u r opposed to exapanding horizons n terms of race and diversity so this conversation is meaningless to have and I don't have time to water with u.  Bye black heroes hater•ÈÀ

Did you even watched the trailer? Peter is in the movie too. Being white is not a big part of Spider-Man's character. He has been bitten by a radioactive spider and learns to use his powers responsibly.•ÈÀ

@Prince Darwin noir meanz black so yea•ÈÀ
@SamuraiMarmoset he is from the 1920-30 and hes kind of a detective i think idk. But it makes sense in that time. And it fits in the setting hes in normally. And he is more of a stealthy character•ÈÀ
@harshvardhan singh the noir im spiderman noir doeant mean black. Its reffering to the genre of old crime films. That style of movie is in the noir genre. Thats where the name comes from•ÈÀ
"Oh, I know who he is, but what I mean is this film's take on him makes him look a LOT beefier than I think he's  normally portrayed.•ÈÀ"
@SamuraiMarmoset he is pretty beefy last time i checked but if not trench coats do make you look thicc•ÈÀ
Wasn‰Ûªt he created for the Shattered Dimensions game?•ÈÀ
@_ Insomniac _ probably not•ÈÀ
He was not. Noir already existed in the comics before Shattered Dimensions was released. At the very least he'd had his first one-shot adventure.•ÈÀ
"My bad I thought the Spider-Man Noir comic was created the same year Shattered Dimensions came out, as a tie in.•ÈÀ"

"Pablo Pineiro yeah but this is a spiderverse movie, it's based on the comics, not the videogame.•ÈÀ"
"Yes, I clearly know that. Thats why I explained the reason why I prefer the story from the game, it was more genuine in comparison.•ÈÀ"

"Yeah, the detail in this is crazy. Sony animation is actually a pretty solid studio, they just usually don't have good stories (emoji movie anyone?). This time it looks like it's a different story.•ÈÀ"

"Am I seriously one of the only people that notices the low framerates? Don't get me wrong, the animation looks fantastic and I love the color and art style. But this trailer is straight up laggy. Idk if i would be able to watch a full length movie like that.•ÈÀ"
Pretty sure its on purpose... Makes it look like a comic book•ÈÀ
Brandon West the action scenes have more frames than the casual ones. Its a stylistic choice and I think it works•ÈÀ
"Obviously it's a design choice and they did it on purpose, I'm not disputing that.I just think it looks laggy in spots.If they can give the action scenes more frames then why not do the same for the casual scenes?In my opinion the low frames don't make the film look any more like a comic book, the art style and animations are what make it look that way.•ÈÀ"
"Brandon West it was simply done to save on time,effort and budget while looking good.•ÈÀ"
"@Keroikun Alright man, I'll take your word for it... I tried looking up the budget and found no info for that yet. It definitely saved time, no arguments there.I feel like not rushing it and having consistent frames across the board would make it look better, but that's just my opinion.It's going to look fantastic either way.•ÈÀ"

What? What the hell you talking about? You sound like a crazy person.•ÈÀ
"Hm the first few trailers I‰Ûªve seen of this got me really excited for this movie but seeing so many spider people is kinda off putting.. like I‰Ûªm 100% sure the pig is just going to be comedic relief. Idk in my opinion it would‰Ûªve been cool just to stick with the three (og sm, Mike‰Ûªs, and qwen) I‰Ûªm still hype but idk _Ù_á‰Û‰ªÛ•ü hope it‰Ûªs better then I expect•ÈÀ"
"Its also great that Spider Noir is less edgy graphic novel vigilante.and more Batman TAS or Adam West styled trench coat investigator that was also common for the era.•ÈÀ"

why do we need another spiderman???•ÈÀ
"What about Spider-Man 2099He was soooo cool•ÈÀ"
I'm actually hype for this movie until they show a goddamn anime looking japanese spider girl•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker (the ""anime Spider-Girl"") is an an established part of the Marvel Spider-Verse canon, and in this instance she is the Japanese representative of the Spider-verse in an animated movie. Why wouldn't they give her an anime gimmick? It'd have been a major missed opportunity if they didn't, and it just makes more sense then not (it also prevents her from just coming across like a generic gender-swapped-Asian-Spider-Man clone).•ÈÀ"
i actually did not care about this movie until they show a goddam spider loli•ÈÀ
you complaining about Peni Parker but not Spider Ham??? the hell Leave our girl Peni Parker alone•ÈÀ
"Will there be more Spider-Men? Like Spider-Knight, Spider-Girl, Spider-Man 2099, or Scarlet Spider?•ÈÀ"
"There should be like 30 more spiders. Assassin spider man, spider girl from old man logan, superior spiderman, spider punk, spider cyborg, cosmic spider,  LOTS....•ÈÀ"
"I think there are more than enough already. The pacing might get clunky if they have to develop a whole bunch of spider people. Also, this is supposed to be a Miles movie, and it's already going to be hard to balance that with all of these other main characters.•ÈÀ"
I'm hoping to see those characters•ÈÀ

@Shawn so Man-Spider is like Man-Bat•ÈÀ
They will never put 90s spider-man only 2000s spider-man•ÈÀ
"@Matthew A.K.A GermanDogGaming basically yeah. But unlike man-bat who is Kirk Langstrom, Man-Spider was Peter after his ""mutation"" progressed. At least that's what I remember from the late 90's. Spider-Man the animated series.•ÈÀ"
"@Shawn wow thanks for the explanation,did you grew up from the comics.I grew up from the movies•ÈÀ"
"Next thing I know there will be crispy, roasted spiders•ÈÀ"
"Don't forget the emmisary of hell himself, SUPAIDAMAN•ÈÀ"
"@Matthew A.K.A GermanDogGaming  TV animations in 80s & 90's when I was a kid/teenager.I read some comics, Spider-Ham as a real young kid, the first series from 1960's when I was a teenager and ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" series that started sometime around when the first movie came out. 2001 I think? That series is where Miles first appeared. I'm glad an older Peter is in this film to mentor him.•ÈÀ"
Trans spider is coming soon.•ÈÀ
@Shawn would be great if you guys did some research before saying stuff youre not even sure about. Doppelganger was created by the Magus in the Infinity War arc. He's not an alternate Peter Parker https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelganger_(comics)•ÈÀ
@Shawn no he's not•ÈÀ
@Matthew A.K.A GermanDogGaming nope•ÈÀ
@Shawn there is a peter parker like that in the spiderverse comics but Doppelganger is an entirely separate character. He was more like an animal and Carnage and Shriek kept him as a pet•ÈÀ

"So Ultimate Peter Parker is like a celebrity superhero. Pretty popular, well off and well loved (mostly). Then Miles gets his powers, Ultimate PP dies, Kingpin creates his collider and 616-Peter arrives. He's the Spider-Man we know and love. Plucky, perpetually struggling to make ends meet, but the hero with the most solid moral core you'll meet. You can hear it in the tone of voice too. Ultimate Peter Parker sounds like a badass, gruff and tough. Our Peter Parker sounds like a loveable dork.•ÈÀ"

After being absolutely devastatingly heartbroken and crying my eyeballs out I took a moment to go through my Hospital paperwork and lo and behold , would you believe it that MY TEST RESULTS WERE ALL NEGATIVE Not Even A FALSE POSITIVE for Any & All Drugs tested for _Ù÷Á so the next day when I was scheduled to see her for our first VISITATION date when I arrived I met with the temporary foster-care parent and couldn't hold my composure and just had to share the good news that I in fact was innocent of their fraudulent claims and insisted that she too relay the message to her as well as the rest of her colleagues also that I would be definitely SUEING THE HECK OUTTA THIER AGENCY FOR FALSIFIED INFORMATION TO REMOVE MY DAUGHTER, afterwards I'd say maybe a couple of hours while we were out shopping I get in the car and notice I got a Missed call and Received a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE and it was from the Social Worker letting us know their wasn't going to be a COURT HEARING any longer that it had been cancelled do to the fact we were CLEARED of ALL ALLEGATIONS only thing was that there still be an investigation period of just 30 days and Aeriel was READY TO BE PICKED UP AT ANY TIME TO GO HOME WITH US ASAP. You bet your ; We drove Soo darn fast to whatever daycare looking center place as I skipped and ran to retrieve My precious babygirl, it was Soo surreal it was unbelievably awesome to hear those words I thought I'd never hear but to _Ù÷see and feel her back in My arms MOMMA'S ARMS was simply AMAZING ‰£•ü That is how I figured out their little scheme. _Ù_Ó•ÈÀ"

BERNARDINE MEDICAL CENTER) where I delivered my son on July 12, 2018 @t 3:16am I  gave birth to My Newborn healthy 6 lbs 13 oz 18 inches beautiful babyboy, 24 hours after delivery as Both Mother & Baby were approved to be DISCHARGED, at the last minute Thee Nurses staff stalled Parents whom were unaware of being Reported to CPS, and were just patiently waiting for the removal of the infant's ankle monitor Security Band on his right foot. Nobody informed Neither Mother nor Father there was reason to Believe OuR child wouldn't  be safe with Us and so thee entire stay I was under thee impression all was good and well considering I was bonding (skin to skin) and caring for my newborn as thee natural Loving and nurturing mother I was reassured as I was being while My attending nurse constantly closely examined my interactions and attention level with assurance I was properly attending to my baby's needs, noone made no such mentionings of Concern as to why A REPORT WAS MADE AND NEVER DISCUSSION OF IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION , UNFORTUNATELY no medical staff attempted to disclose any info as they unprofessionally improperly intervened my DISCHARGE in progress as We were LITERALLY ABOUT TO BE RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL TO GO HOME, But as soon as we were about to head out Seriously unbelievably the unimaginable occurred which 'THEY' USED AS AN EXCUSE TO KEEP US FROM GOING ANYWHERE ESPECIALLY ANYWHERE NEAR GOING TO HOME SWEET HOME so they Schemed Me and my newborn into confinement to My Hospital Room & unknowingly awaited the arrival of ONE Law Enforcement officer of San Bernardino Police Department , & 1 CPS SOCIAL WORKER FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY (Central Office) CFS  CHILDREN'S FAMILY SERVICES in Cahoots with this‰_¥•üMedical Kidnap_Ù ÷ & Didso WITHOUT A WARRANT ‰ä•ü‰ÑTHEY Violated My Rights !?!•ÈÀ"

Wait a sec... OG Spidey here is the same from the Raimi films?!? AWESOME!!!•ÈÀ
Should‰Ûªve increased FPS•ÈÀ
"Starting with 0:10 loving the call backs to the Sam Raimi films with the train sequence, the rain kiss, and the Dock Ock car throw scene (He just straight up punches it this time haha). I'm loving the dynamic between Pete and Miles, the references to the other Spideys, and I just adore the art direction.Can't wait to catch this is theaters.•ÈÀ"
"All the spidey peeps:0:06 Peter Parker AKA Spider-man0:03 Miles Morales AKA Ultimate Spiderman1:23 Gwen Stacy AKA Spider-Gwen1:36 1930s Peter Parker AKA Spider-man Noir1:37 Peni Parker AKA SP//DR1:40 Peter Porker AKA Spider-HamAll dem villains:0:54 and 1:54 Kingpin1:53 Prowler2:06 Ultimate Goblin1:55 The guy with the grey face is either Morlun or Tombstone.

Pls pin this•ÈÀ
"Maybe the movie is Super six v sinister six, idk•ÈÀ"
The guy with grey face is probably hammerhead•ÈÀ
My guess is the guy with the gray face is tombstone because of the motorcycle in the cut beforehand•ÈÀ
Definitely tompstone•ÈÀ
1:39 SM PS4 behind Aunt May•ÈÀ
That is tombstone•ÈÀ
I think grey face is the vulture from noir•ÈÀ
_ÙÔÎ_ÙÔÎ_ÙÔÎ•ÈÀ
The spiderham is the best one•ÈÀ
It's definitely tombstone•ÈÀ
1:55 gray guy could be mr negative but that's just a guess•ÈÀ
"You can obviously identify that he is tombstone, just look up his character he has the same hair and gray skin, morlun has a long black hair•ÈÀ"

Where is miguel o hara•ÈÀ
So that's what happens after he gets bitten in spiderman ps4•ÈÀ
"The animation is simply breathtaking, and the plot, though it seems a bit generic, appears to be superb in terms of execution. I am truly looking forward to this movie now!This movie seems very reminiscent of the Lego Movie, entertaining, self-aware, though it also contains a hint of the powerful thematic statements that made the Lego Movie such an excellent film. In addition, I just can't get enough of that artistic style, the way that this movie employs the colorful and cartoony animation, complete with visible sound effects, as if this film were directly converted from the pages of a comic. This film seems to know what it wants to be, and so far what I'm seeing is absolutely spectacular!Besides, I had to suppress a squeal when I saw the anime-style spiderman. The style just works so well, on every single freakin' character! God am I exhilarated!•ÈÀ"

Not gonna lie I was pretty hyped for this when I saw the trailer during Deadpool 2. I don't really know a whole lot about about Miles and Spider Gwen but it looks like a fun movie and these newer SJW characters done right. The female version of Hawkeye feels like another character I'm willing to give a fair shake but the rest of these new characters seem too cocky and pretentious.•ÈÀ

Nice original comment you got there•ÈÀ
trailer was going good until they added anime•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker (the ""anime Spider-Girl"") is the Japanese representative of the Spider-verse in an animated movie. Why wouldn't they give her an anime gimmick? It'd have been a major missed opportunity if they didn't, and it just makes more sense then not (it also prevents her from just coming across like a generic gender-swapped-Asian-Spider-Man clone).•ÈÀ"

h h your trolling is obvious.•ÈÀ
So you're talking about some DC movie in the comment section of a Sony movie... Why?•ÈÀ
Joshi Dhruv because i thought dc made this movie. so i was saying finally they made a good movie. i didnt know  only sonymade spiderman movies•ÈÀ
"h h Soooo... You're not trolling, you're just stupid?•ÈÀ"
"Literally uploaded by Sony Pictures and there are 3 Sony logos in the trailer, so if you're really not trolling how did you possibly think this is DC?•ÈÀ"
"Joshi Dhruv no i knew sony produced the movie but i thought it was made by dc. like avengers was produced by sony but made with marvel, and i had heard this one was dc•ÈÀ"

I see it•ÈÀ
Axel Arnal actually that‰Ûªs not true at all. It was created by Insomniac for the game. He‰Ûªs an alternate version of Peter Parker. The Insomniac version of Spider-Man is making an appearance in the Spider-Geddon comic book. But he was created for the game.•ÈÀ
Now thats a catch!•ÈÀ

Wait what•ÈÀ
Don't read too many comics so kinda confusing for me•ÈÀ
"The Spiderverse, this is the event when many spiderman from across the multiple universes joining together to fight a common evil, this is the comic atleast•ÈÀ"
"Siam Kabir basically, there are a bunch of different spider-themed heroes in Marvel comics. Most of them never met. However, there was a big event where they all met. All of them. If you could slap the word Spider on it, it was a version of spider-man and it was there. I don‰Ûªt know if any of this helps ease the confusion, but that‰Ûªs the shortest possible explanation.•ÈÀ"
"Just go with the  flow, it was kind of a mess in the comics so let's hope this wont be.•ÈÀ"
"Okay, so, first, there are multiple ""universes"" in the comic books where you have the same people but things happen to them just a bit differently and they have different continuities. The main Marvel universe is known as 616. About 20 years ago, they introduced a second one known as the Ultimate universe which is where Miles comes from - he replaced Peter after Ultimate Peter died. A third universe is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (which is kind of mish mash of 616, Ultimate, and original elements). Every time a character gets a new continuity, it gets a new universe. There's a zombie universe, a manga universe, if you're a reader of the daily, Spider-Man newspaper strips, that's a universe. All of the cartoons get their own universes. The live action 1970's TV show. The live action 1970's JAPANESE TV show. Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark. All in different Marvel universes.A few years back, they did an event where all of the Spider-People meet each other in order to fight a Big Bad. On top of the above universes, they also invented a few new Spider-People. Spider-Man Noir, Peni with her robot, and most famously Spider-Woman who is known amongst the fan base as Spider-Gwen (and is in the middle of a rename to Ghost Spider??). In her universe, instead of being Peter's tragically murdered girlfriend, she got bit by the radioactive spider, Peter started experimenting on himself to turn himself into The Lizard, and Peter ended up becoming Gwen's tragically dead boyfriend, instead.•ÈÀ"

you should read more comics•ÈÀ
This is also made by Sony•ÈÀ
Radical Butters doesn‰Ûªt mean it didn‰Ûªt happen in the movies too. It‰Ûªs still plausible•ÈÀ
Most probably that the Spider-Man of that universe shares events from the Sam Raimi films but are slightly different like the train for instance where he's still got his mask on.•ÈÀ
But he wasn't wearing his spidersuit when the car crashed through the window in Tobey's version. Nor did he punch it. If anything it proves that it's not following those movies.•ÈÀ
"yeah..its crossover from another dimension.. 1:02like peter parker from sam raimi trilogyand peni parker from sp//dr•ÈÀ"
Another SJW crap from Sony...•ÈÀ
"Yeaaaaa... Equal rights for pigss , pigs all around the world are gonna be happy to see their kind being represented as one of the main characters•ÈÀ"
Triggered anti-SJW. Literally the exact same behaviour as those people you hate.•ÈÀ
"rohith kumar There was actually a dialogue in comic where Spider Ham says ‰ÛÏthat‰Ûªs racist‰Û when someone notes that he is a pig•ÈÀ"
"@Hyun Dong Lee _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â.. really, guess i forgot that. Funny how everything looks like SJW for people these days•ÈÀ"
"rohith kumar Can‰Ûªt help it from all Anti SJW channels like The Quartering No BSAnd more•ÈÀ"
"Bro, I'm as against SJW culture as you can get and this movie looks amazing. I was sceptical at first, but if this trailer is anything to go by this is gonna be one heck of a hilarious, wild wide. Loving the different versions of the character, all totally different. Your typical Peter Parker, a young Spider-Man of colour (Miles Morales), a lady Spider-Woman (Spider-Gwen), a Japanese anime Spider-Girl (Peni Parker) and a Spider pig (Spider-Ham). I don't like when there's forced diversity in something but this isn't ""forced diversity"", and if you think it is you're just an idiot. When something is good it's good regardless of the diversity of the cast. Just because there's a black Spider-Man and two female Spider-People it doesn't make it an SJW move. The two male Spider-Men meeting a Gwen who became Spider-Woman as well as a ""loli"" anime schoolgirl who became her version of Spider-Man is a great concept with a lot of potential for interesting and funny interaction. And the comedic opportunities for all of them meeting a pig version of Spider-Man basically write themselves. Don't write something off just because it happens to have a few females in it, or a character who isn't American or white. That's just as ignorant, if not more so, then the SJWs that you dislike.•ÈÀ"

This trailer kinda grossed me out.

"Shame they didn't spring for 25 frames per second. The jerkiness from watching the trailers is distracting enough I don't know how I'll do with a full film. Cheap, Sony, cheap...•ÈÀ"
https://youtu.be/Fm5WvAG5Mrc•ÈÀ
"I think it was an artistic choice rather than them just being cheap, i mean, they're not a small company and can afford to make it look smooth.•ÈÀ"
"That's entirely plausible and my opinion, like all others, is subjective. But that you used the word 'smooth' to describe what the animation isn't speaks volumes. Sony have had their fingers burned by Spider-Man before by over-reaching, perhaps they've deliberately scaled back their investment here to see how it does, going for the anti-smooth level of animation.Perhaps they are trying to harken to a time of more primitive, hand-drawn animation? But this is a world of Disney/Pixar, Illumination, Blue Sky, even Sony Animation and they all do 24+fps for a reason.The trailer has the feel of something which was meant for straight-to-DVD, I would like something which was meant for the big screen.•ÈÀ"
"Speaking as someone in the animation industry, what you are seeing is what is commonly referred to as animating on two's. It's 100% an aesthetic choice and comes with its own challenges and limitations. Basically they key animation on every second frame and mimics stop motion animation, the real reason why I think they did it is because animating on two's allows for really snappy awesome action animation where the character snaps from pose to pose. This also makes sense with the fact that they are trying to make it look as much like a comic book as possible. Spiderman is known for his iconic and dynamic poses. Animating him on ones or ""smoother"" would sacrifice the snappy iconic poses for fluidity. Some people would prefer the fluidity over a more stylized look but it comes down to taste. But it's intentional and doesn't really reduce cost much at all.Again up to taste.•ÈÀ"

"I know everyone's looking forward to this, especially me, but just remember... They also made the emoji movie...•ÈÀ"
"Hush hush, you must never speak of the devil.•ÈÀ"
This is written by Phil Lord And Chris Miller it‰Ûªll be good•ÈÀ
"Mr Critical Everyone talks about Emoji movies, but does anybody talk about Hotel Transylvania?•ÈÀ"
I love how he just punched the car back out the coffee shop _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
The character model's texture art style really reminds me of Telltale games. Telltale could make a game with almost this level of quality if it weren't for a series of unfortunate events.•ÈÀ
what spiderman•ÈÀ
"If you keep it up, Sony Animation, I'll forgive you for the emoji movie.•ÈÀ"
"Chris C. Why would you forgive them, it was a masterpiece•ÈÀ"
The people who are hating are probably fans of the homecoming movie because I see them everywhere complaining about bol crap•ÈÀ
"I disliked homcoming and I dislike this new trailer, I think every Spiderman movie they are releasing are getting worse.•ÈÀ"
Spiderman is overrated. Stan Lee is overrated.•ÈÀ
"Yadhira MuÌ±oz La Reyna Del Chisme Not really, I don‰Ûªt think anyone that likes Homecoming won‰Ûªt like this•ÈÀ"
"Lucas 7777 Did you like Amazing Spider Man 2?•ÈÀ"
"@Hyun Dong Lee No I didn't like it, my least favorite Spiderman movie.•ÈÀ"
@Lucas 7777 I agree with the homecoming part•ÈÀ
@Show down agree with that one too•ÈÀ
@Hyun Dong Lee I say this because I see them complain the most•ÈÀ
@Hyun Dong Lee not really though I still like Emma Gwen Stacy performance•ÈÀ
"Yadhira MuÌ±oz La Reyna Del Chisme How much box office will this movie make?500 million? 600 million?•ÈÀ"
@Hyun Dong Lee idk but hopefully the movie would be a good adapation a least•ÈÀ
Only in theaters _Ù÷Õ•ÈÀ
Is it necessary to bring people from other universe?_Ù_£_Ù÷â_Ù_£_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
But why BLACK ? Should have been WHITE. This movie sucks already !•ÈÀ
"Why not? all of the other spidermans are different from one another. They even put in an anime girl for christ's sake, so why shouldn't there be a black spiderman as well?•ÈÀ"
"That's Miles Morales, the Ultimate Spider Man from the comics, you probably didn't read comics, haven't you?•ÈÀ"
Only watched this cz I thought id here post malone's new song.•ÈÀ
Black Spider-Man? _Ù_¢•ÈÀ
Oh no _Ù_¨•ÈÀ
What's wrong with it?•ÈÀ
This movie is gonna surpass my expectations and it‰Ûªs already bowing my mind.•ÈÀ
This actually looks really good•ÈÀ
"More forced diversity by the anti-white agenda. You know, the other day I was at Walmart ready to shop when some Hispanic cartpusher who worked there had the audacity to say ""sir, do you need a cart?"" Can you imagine that!!? He didn't even bow down before my divinity. I notified his manager, thank God she was white, to fire him and showed myself out. Just another day suffering in the first world. White people's burden I guess.•ÈÀ"
"Why is it ""forced diversity"" whenever a person of another race is part of a cast or the main character? why can't a black person have an important role?•ÈÀ"
If this comment is satirical and sarcastic and mocking conservative racists then it's pretty funny..... If not you can just shut up•ÈÀ
Can we do this movie but without the spider-verse?•ÈÀ
Omg they are going with the og Tobey Maguire Spiderman! _Ù÷_Ù÷•ÈÀ
"I'm pretty sure they were just supposed to be jokes, like meta references. It probably isnt the same spider-man.•ÈÀ"
@kizmazter123 we'll have to wait and see•ÈÀ
"@Bitter Sweet Truth well considering it showed us the same scene from spider-man 2 where he is on a date with MJ and in this version he punched the car in his spidey suit as apposed to diving out of the way as peter parker, it is probably safe to say its just a meta reference.•ÈÀ"
"@kizmazter123 true but there were so many tho like the train scene, the kissing MJ scene and even tho that scene might be a lil different it's still v similar also there was a small glimpse of him fighting doc ock, but yeah either way both much appreciated whether it's just Easter eggs or actually Tobeys version•ÈÀ"
"@Bitter Sweet Truth yeah, but during the train scene he had his mask on, he doesnt have it on in spider-man 2. So my best guess is that they are just meta references. Still cool either way.•ÈÀ"
‰ÛÏRemember what makes you different is that you‰Ûªre black‰Û•ÈÀ

Looks like DC is also about to lose the animated movie battle...•ÈÀ

This is freaking savage!•ÈÀ
"(Spider-Ham) Can I please go home to my own universe? NO! In fact, we're going to frame you for murder! And you're going to jail for 30 years!!!•ÈÀ"
Why do I want to watch a Spider-man movie with the main character not being Peter Parker/Spider-man???•ÈÀ
Because you're basic•ÈÀ
"Dragin Also, considering how many Spider-Man movies are about Peter ParkerAnswer: all 6 until now•ÈÀ"
Dragin - would watch a Batman movie that‰Ûªs about Robin lmaooooo talk about basic•ÈÀ
"@IBlewUponYourFace if it's about Robin, that makes it a Robin movie.•ÈÀ"
Oh yess its my time to shine•ÈÀ
I love spider man•ÈÀ
Love this art-form!•ÈÀ
"3D, 2D, Stop Motion (?), ComicsI've never seen a movie like this before. I'm increasingly excited.•ÈÀ"

@Optimal Rodimus Megatron OK you welcome•ÈÀ
_ÙÕ»‰÷¼‰÷¼•ÈÀ
11/10 best trailer this year•ÈÀ
Now that‰Ûªs how you properly incorporate a black character into a role previously held by a white character.•ÈÀ
What? Miles Morales was never white?•ÈÀ
"Black Miles was the second Spider-Man AFTER White Peter Parker. Had they just rebooted Spider-Man with a Black Peter Parker and a Black Uncle Ben, that would have been unsat. But I can dig how they transitioned this black character into the role.•ÈÀ"
Miles was never white lmao•ÈÀ
Tess Read.•ÈÀ
Why can‰Ûªt Sony just play the trailer without doing the little synopsis of the trailer before the trailer starts?  It‰Ûªs annoying.•ÈÀ
This gon be good•ÈÀ
john mulaney in this is perf omfg•ÈÀ
I wanna be spider girl know...•ÈÀ
Please just don't make him gay•ÈÀ
"I can already see people shipping him with an aged-down Peter Parker, heck probably not even that. I wouldn't put it past the internet. I don't see anything wrong with him being gay though, if the creators wanted him to be.•ÈÀ"
Lepidocrocite Quartz these guys are not meant to be gay at all•ÈÀ
@Benito Mussolini  I'm talking about the whole sjw homosexual Miles Morales thing•ÈÀ
@Lepidocrocite Quartz making Peter Parker fall in love with Gwen Stacy or MJ was cringey enough and if they make Miles Morales gay that is just too much cringe for me it is supposed to be a superhero movie not a reality TV show you know what I mean more action less emotion•ÈÀ
"I mean i guess a movie could just be about action, but this one does look like it will have some emotion in it as well. I guess romance isn't for everyone.•ÈÀ"
@Lepidocrocite Quartz you don't get it superhero movies are not about romance they're about conflict if I wanted to watch a movie about romance I would watch a chick flick•ÈÀ
"A movie can be more than one genre you know, and besides, Peter Parker and many other superheros have love interests of their own.•ÈÀ"
its like a video game_Ù÷ •ÈÀ
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
woah they have spiderman noir in this?? no way•ÈÀ
"This is actually a lot better than the other trailer, hope it's actually not bad•ÈÀ"
Are we all gonna ignore the fact that Spiderman is black in this movie and people are ok with that?•ÈÀ
"It's apart of the comics you dipshit, he's even in the new Spider-Man game on PS4, google Miles Morales•ÈÀ"
@sykky No I don't want to waste my time.•ÈÀ
Are we watching different trailers or something because I swear I see at least two Peter Parker's in the trailer.•ÈÀ
Our guy Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
"Don't really care for Sony but I really don't want my boy Miles the be messed up, so I hope this does really really well•ÈÀ"
"Spider man is black now , what did the left Purge Peter Parker for being White?•ÈÀ"
Miles was created in 2012 and there is literally 2 Peters in the trailer....•ÈÀ
wait wtf wheres jewish spiderman?•ÈÀ
"Ok update spider cast, OG peter parker, miles moralis the ultimate spiderman, spider gwen/gwen stacey, noir spiderman, anime girl with spider robot, and last but not least.. peter porker aka _Ù¥ü_ÙáSPIDER HAM_Ùá _Ù¥ü•ÈÀ"

I was a bit skeptical until this trailer. Still don't like Peter's voice but this movie looks super fun. It looks a lot like the Lego movie with all its different cast of characters.•ÈÀ

Im hyped•ÈÀ
1 05 soggy•ÈÀ
Sony did something right?!?!•ÈÀ
THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!!!!•ÈÀ
So is no one going to talk about the anime-looking girl or??? like i'm the only one who was taken aback by her existence right?•ÈÀ
"Her names Peni Parker, she from the Spidey verse comic event , and recent spider geddon event, although her mech isn't accurate in the movie, in the comics she's basically from an anime inspired Neon Genesis  Evangelion type world, and her spidey mech looks like it too. It's pretty dope.•ÈÀ"
"Peni Parker (the ""anime Spider-Girl"") is the Japanese representative of the Spider-verse in an animated movie. Why wouldn't they give her an anime gimmick? It'd have been a major missed opportunity if they didn't, and it just makes more sense then not (it also prevents her from just coming across like a generic gender-swapped-Asian-Spider-Man clone).•ÈÀ"
"Well i'm just saying that I've never heard of her before, and you don't usually see anime girls in animated movies made by Americans. Don't get me wrong though, i love what they're doing here!•ÈÀ"
The anime girl got me woked•ÈÀ
Looks stupid•ÈÀ
Sony bought Spiderman to life...... _ÙÔÎ_Ù÷_•ÈÀ

#BringBackStaticShock•ÈÀ
I can't wait!!! _Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷•ÈÀ
Yo im sorta diggin this new art direction with this movie. The action is super fluid and less motion intense scenes have this choppy look to it. Its sorta charming•ÈÀ
M Etuks Ahh it's like influenced by stop motion and I love it.•ÈÀ
"They insert random 2D still ""comic"" frames in the middle of all the action scenes, and the overall effect is cool as hell.•ÈÀ"
sorta? lol•ÈÀ
you think this style is not choppy lol•ÈÀ
"I love the art style and animation, but I'm really not a huge fan of CGI rendered at a low frame rate as a cheaper way to make '2D'. The 3D artists and animators have done a fantastic job and the studio should embrace that, not try to hide it.•ÈÀ"
"That shit‰Ûªs sick as hell. I love the animation style. It‰Ûªs like, stop motion and comic style.•ÈÀ"
roby faraa isnt it supposed to be?•ÈÀ

Can. Not. Wait.•ÈÀ
"In ten years, all comic book heros, even Superman will be cast as black.......goodbye world as we know it.....•ÈÀ"
You do know that it's a different Spider-Man entirely right?•ÈÀ
"Miles Morales is literally in the comics...he is black and has always been black, this isn't just a pc casting thing, it's who the character is.Regardless of that, black and poc characters have been played by white people for decades so would it really scar ya little butthurt heart that much if we switched it around for a few years?also just some info for you to keep in mind! White isn't default_Ù÷_•ÈÀ"
"Don't you know that all marvel movie and dc movie based on comic book right? And that comic book already released long before the movie comes out. there are a lot of version of 1 superhero and all different character.•ÈÀ"
I love Spiderman•ÈÀ
A Black Peter Parker?!?!?!?•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
Different person Miles is from the comics•ÈÀ
They really got the spiderpig... from the simpsons•ÈÀ
It's actually a character from the comics called Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
"The anime girl in the trailer is Peni Parker, in case anyone was curious.•ÈÀ"
So what i understand they are gonna grup up and Destroy something and this is not an origin story of another Spiderman but a friend team up•ÈÀ
Pretty much like what the Ninja Turtles did•ÈÀ
"Pause at Aunt May and in the background, there‰Ûªs the Advanced Suit from Insomniac‰Ûªs Marvel‰Ûªs Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
Nah•ÈÀ

The movie would be better if peter looked different.•ÈÀ
Nice boi•ÈÀ
"Mneh. Not bad, but nothing I'd really pay to see•ÈÀ"

Bill Russell Has been canon since the 80s.•ÈÀ
who's the loli?•ÈÀ
That's what i'm wondering.•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm so excited for this•ÈÀ
So hyped for this movie they nailed the voice actors! Hope that my favorite spider-character shows up and it's the Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly). And I heard the Andrew Garfields and Tobey Maguires Spider-Men might show up! So I'm hyped for that to happen. Also at 1:36 nic cage is Noir Spider-Man! I want him to play Noir Spidey in the mcu If this movie isn't connected to the mcu like the rumors are. But still hyped! And also look behind aunt may at 1:39. Is that Spider-Man PS4 I see! Wink! Wink! _Ù÷ä•ÈÀ
Omg! This trailer rocks _Ù_©_Ù_©_Ù_©_Ù_©•ÈÀ

@Lucas 7777 lul that's a good 1•ÈÀ
"Not digging the hairstyle, to be honest•ÈÀ"
Nice to smash tho•ÈÀ
@Lucas 7777 no because you should read spiderverse first if you think this is weird•ÈÀ
Or Nic Cage?•ÈÀ
"@Lucas 7777 Her name's Peni Parker, and her universe anime is a real thing.•ÈÀ"
eliborio camacho Totally digging her hair style tbh.•ÈÀ
"€¡f it was a New character it would be a good thing to make him black,but changing a character that has stayed white for decades has nothing do with racism,you cant make black panther white,or spider MAN black,just keep them as in the comics•ÈÀ"
"Dude...he is a new character. The original spiderman is literally there in the trailer. This is a different person, not a black Peter Parker.•ÈÀ"
It's Miles Morales•ÈÀ
@Lepidocrocite Quartz I think some people are blind in the comment section•ÈÀ
"Yeah, and just plain stupid.•ÈÀ"
"@Lepidocrocite Quartz no need to call me stupid,actually l didnt notice Peter was there,so there is no problem•ÈÀ"

"What I love is the contrast of stylesSpider Ham moves like a classic looney tunes cartoon character The anime girl Peni is overly cutesy and looks as flat straight out of a manga or animeAnd spider noir looks like he‰Ûªs straight out of a newspaper, right down to the fact that he‰Ûªs still black white and gray•ÈÀ"

"Is there actually a version of Spiderman that's a little weeb girl with a bot in the comics? Cuz that's awesome.•ÈÀ"
Yep!•ÈÀ
"Go read Spider-verse (the comic) and its tie-ins. That's where they introduced Peni Parker and Spider-Gwen alongside many others like Spider-Punk, Lady Spider and a Uncle Ben Spider-man. There's even a part where the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-man were mentioned. Not to mention, the story also brought in one of my favorites: A Japanese Spider-man who pilots a giant mech named Leopardon from a 1970s tokusatsu show from Toei. Because of this particular Spider-man, Power Rangers (or Super Sentai) now has their Megazords.•ÈÀ"
What if the peter Parker we get in miles universe is Tom Holland•ÈÀ
I wish that Tobey was one of the voice actors would've made my life complete.•ÈÀ
Xofficialjzm could be old spider man.•ÈÀ
It's entirely possible that Tobey Maguire's Spiderman will show up in the movie.•ÈÀ
i think that version of peter parker could be based on tobey.  theres a scene in the trailer where hes looking at Mj‰Ûªs photo.  from the universe hes from maybe pete is spiderman still and married to Mj.•ÈÀ
It wouldn't have been as fun.•ÈÀ
Tobeys Spider Man is a drag.•ÈÀ

Black Spiderman? Okay... Isn't Spiderman supposed to stop crime though?•ÈÀ
"Anyone else wish this was live action and not animated, or at least a different style of animation?•ÈÀ"

"Not gonna lie, at first I thought this whole thing was a big political stunt but it's pretty creative and genuine and I shouldn't have been so quick to judge.•ÈÀ"
What makes it political? The fact that Miles Morales is in it?•ÈÀ
"@Das It Mane yeah I didn't know that was a thing, just thought they turned Spiderman black, like a few other cast decisions throughout films. It is a little niche to begin with.•ÈÀ"
Miles Morales has been in Ultimate Spiderman for years. This isnt new and this story has been sort of done in the comics as well•ÈÀ
Tom Holland WANT EM HERE•ÈÀ
A trilogy fer sure...hands down best animation style ever!•ÈÀ
yall know the music in the trailer•ÈÀ
it was better than captain marvel trailer•ÈÀ
"yeah, marvel trailers are usually top notch but that one was a miss for me.•ÈÀ"
This one did have a distinct lack of punched grandmas though...•ÈÀ
"Dream-Piper Also, this one spoiled ‰ÛÏWORLD COLLIDE‰ÛNo one expected that, and they should not have revealed it in a trailer•ÈÀ"
"To be fair, Captain Marvel only has a teaser trailer. This is the second official trailer for Into the Spider-verse.•ÈÀ"

Two completely different films. Nice try starting flame war in comments. Dickhead•ÈÀ
"EASILY..... matter of fact, this is the best comic book movie trailer since Infinity War ( Antman and Wasp was ok, but this is better). I had ZERO faith in this... Now I'm hyped for it. Good trailer.•ÈÀ"
But they just explained the entire plot....•ÈÀ
12fps??? _Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
I recognize all but the little girl. Who is she?•ÈÀ
Peni Parker•ÈÀ
She‰Ûªs from a Japense Manga. She controls the Spider-Mech. Also named Peni Parker•ÈÀ
This opens the door to so many more animated AAA films•ÈÀ
AAA films?•ÈÀ
you don't get AAA films•ÈÀ
@Fumb dumb you know how video games are categorized in budget by AA and AAA? That's what they're talking about.•ÈÀ
@Fumb dumb he means as in super high budget high quality animated movies•ÈÀ
"@Roberto Horacio De Lugo films don't get categorised like that. Also there are lots of high budget animated films by Disney/DreamWorks , his comment doesn't really make any sense.•ÈÀ"
"@Fumb dumb I think what he means is, not many popular or deserving characters get high budget animated movies. So if this is successful, we might get more mainstream animated movies of popular characters.•ÈÀ"
Spiderpig LOL•ÈÀ

I never thought Spider-Pig would actually become canon in Marvel. Always thought it‰Ûªd stay in The Simpsons•ÈÀ
Grant S He was canon before he was in Simpson. He's been around since the 80s.•ÈÀ
Also in ultimate spiderman•ÈÀ
But why 15 fps? Sony could just hire frame animators from there A1-Studio.•ÈÀ
"It's a lot more stylized, and I prefer the more jolty look•ÈÀ"
"@Das It Mane yep it's like stop motion and it is really cool, but like in normal scenes it's stop-motion but in cool scenes they get fluid which looks weird sometimes.•ÈÀ"
@Das It Mane Cool thing that Peter Parker is totally Toby style•ÈÀ
"Take notes, Star Wars. This is how you appease fans.•ÈÀ"

What if the Peter Parker in this is a secret continuation of the Tobey Maguire spiderman. It does show famouse scenes from the trilogy in this trailer in animation form and it would make sense if they wanted to give him a real ending. I really hope that it is him but if not at least have andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire cameo in it just to see them on last time•ÈÀ

He's been canon since forever•ÈÀ

Nope. Spider Ham is from a universd were everybody are animals•ÈÀ
@G-Luke yes finally someone got it right•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham has been around since many years before that one Simpson's joke.  Years of comic book history forgotten because some film makes a dumb joke that vaguely resembles the main character.•ÈÀ
Nah guys Simpson's did it before everyone.•ÈÀ
"@Ricky Camacho, nope.  Spider-Ham first appeared in 1983.  The first episode of SImpson's was 6 years later in 1989, and the Simpson's film, which is where the Spider-Pig song comes from was in 2007, a full 24 years after Spider-Ham. So, no, Spider-Ham was first by 24 years.•ÈÀ"

Why are there so many missing frames it makes it hard to watch and gives the impression that its animated worse than claymation. I shouldnt look at Jason and the Argonaughts and think that has smoother animation than a 2018 studio made movie. It could be done better in Blender on a decent rig.•ÈÀ

"I honestly like the different designs on the spider-men, like spider-ham looking 2-D, Peni Parker and her anime-style, and Nicholas Cage- i mean, Noir looking black and white like something from a private eye show.•ÈÀ"
"I see Marvel Avenegers cartoon its the same so i dont think so there is such difference. The biggest thing will be when all these characters will be in Avengers 4.•ÈÀ"

"Is it me or does Peter Parker seem like a bum more than a scientist?Still gonna watch it but he doesn't feel like your friendly neighbourhood spiderman.•ÈÀ"
JayAwesomeGames probably because he was transported to a different dimension. That might have something to do with it.•ÈÀ
"Well, being transported to another dimension and leaving behind your wallet in your civilian clothes does that to you.Not to mention the fact that you might never exist/ dead in that other dimension doesn't makes things better. That's why superhero costumes need some kind of secret pocket.•ÈÀ"
"Fair points. But it's not even just that, he feels less like the peppy and usually happy spiderman. His sarcasm sounds way more dry than most other interpretations. I think its an interesting take, it gives more of an old man passing on the torch to a younger student feel which fits the movie.•ÈÀ"
"Is that will happen!?!?!? I‰Ûªm sorry I can‰Ûªt speak English well.I wanna know!!!! That‰Ûªs really interesting for me.•ÈÀ"

"Spider-Man doesn't need an R-rating, unless it's adapting Carnage (and even then, it's only R because of how disturbing/violent Carnage, not because they're having Spider-Man swear up a storm). Venom should only be R if he's on his own, if he's just a villain in a Spider-Man movie, then it should be fine as PG-13.•ÈÀ"
@Brendan Milburn so to really reply to something that was a rhetorical question... Is where I'm going with this•ÈÀ
"@Brendan Milburn while I'm ranting lol it's sad my kid gets gamergate at age 12. He understands why star wars sucks. This Spiderman is another pic version everyone can be a Spiderman. His Halo 5... is with girls a black dude and a book they want you to buy. My Halo 1... we had a green dude in a helmet. Hey look _Ù_Ó multiple Spidermans and the main character is black. Wow. I'm pretty sure the entire movie is going to focus on being a woman and being a black man. There is not other reason to bring color into a film when the original was just Peter Parker, a school and daily bugle newspaper writer.•ÈÀ"
Is it just me or does Gwen Stacy look like the Sloth from Ice Age•ÈÀ

How can crime be the one stopping crime?•ÈÀ
Why is this movie in like 10 fps? XD•ÈÀ
It's to mimic hand-drawn animation.•ÈÀ
It's an artistic choice to give the movie a stop motion feel to really sell the comic book look (as it reflects the choppiness of jumping from panel to panel).•ÈÀ
kool•ÈÀ
It's actually 24 with backgrounds rendered in 12 to create the comic book vibe and asthetic•ÈÀ
"yeah ik   but it just feels weird to watch a spider man movie like this I mean it's cool and all, but like It feels like it was made by a marvel fan lol•ÈÀ"
Welcome 2 spider Family..._Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
I FUCKING LOVE THIS•ÈÀ
"Why is the frame rate restricted , I hate it•ÈÀ"

This looks fucking amazing ! This is the kind of Spider man I've been eagerly waiting for !•ÈÀ
spider ham !!!!!!•ÈÀ
"That's John Mulaney as Spider-Ham (Don't know if that's the real name, but it seems like that's what it would be)! Along with Nicholas Cage as Spider-Noir, that is magnificent casting!•ÈÀ"
This is until December•ÈÀ
Seeing it.•ÈÀ
This is how Sony loses another marvel license•ÈÀ
Don't really see how they're going to lose it.•ÈÀ
Anyone know whose voicing Spider-ham?Sounds so familiar but can't put my finger on what other character he sounds like.Driving me crazy trying to think of it.•ÈÀ
John mulaney•ÈÀ
Nick Milner cool thnx•ÈÀ
All doubts I had about this film (even sony ruining it) are gone now•ÈÀ
You are my favorite Minecraft youtuber ever!•ÈÀ
"People saying the animation is awesome... I feel like its laggy and slow... Looks like complete garbage.. And spider man is a white male teenager, so lets keep it that way.•ÈÀ"
I guess you never heard of miles morales then. He's the new spider men after peter dies in the comics.•ÈÀ
"It's an artistic choice to give the movie a stop motion feel to really sell the comic book look (as it reflects the choppiness of jumping from panel to panel).Also, there a multiple Spider-people from different universe, but you'd realized this if you read a comic.•ÈÀ"
You never read the comics huh? There are a lot of alternate universes.•ÈÀ
The Peter Parker Spider-Man hasn't been a teenager for a very long time. Even in Spider-Man 2 he attended college.•ÈÀ
"Peter Parker is a white male teenager. Miles Morales is a black male teenager. Gwen Stacy is a white female teenager. All of which are Spider-themed heroes in their own universes, and all are ALREADY EXISTING CHARACTERS. Stop being stupid.•ÈÀ"

AHHH I CAN'T WAIT•ÈÀ
"Christmas i guess spiderman also dont read the Bible and hes suppose to be considered smart not in my book.  Most ppl wont see how them throwing Christmas content in kids movies.  Sinners will never be satisfied. Ex: I want a playstation 5,6,7,8,9,10 now never satisfied think about it.•ÈÀ"
Oh snap he has a symbiote permanently... oh wait he's black.•ÈÀ
I thought Sony gave the rights to Spider-Man back to marvel or was that only for him to appear in the mcu?? Either way this still looks amazing I‰Ûªd be all for Sony having a animated Spider-Man universe if this goes well•ÈÀ
"OfficerI love you•ÈÀ"
"This is just a way for them to segway Miles into a solo sequel. Sorry, if Peter isn't in it, I won't watch it.•ÈÀ"
Mr. Arnold oof•ÈÀ
"I'd watch a Miles movie, he's got a good personality. Especially dorky, PS4 Miles•ÈÀ"
"Bacon Sir I feel they might make a animated Spider Man 2099 sequel, that‰Ûªs why they didn‰Ûªt include him in the movie•ÈÀ"
I really hope this is good.•ÈÀ
wow. _ÙÔÎ_ÙÔÎ•ÈÀ
Hey Spider-Ham!•ÈÀ
Is he gonna disintegrate•ÈÀ
"Wow. Who else instantly recognize Noir‰Ûªs voice and Hams voice? No?BTW it‰Ûªs, Nicholas Cage, and the great comedian, John Mulaney.•ÈÀ"

This looks so fucking good•ÈÀ
This looks great but for HEAVEN'S SAKE when will Hollywood stop showing the whole plot in their trailers? What's new to expect plot wise? (facepalm)•ÈÀ
"Not all of Hollywood, just Sony. They did the same thing with Homecoming. Not Marvel Studios on the other hand, they KNOW how to keep things tight-lipped.•ÈÀ"
@Darceus but wasn't Homecoming a...... Marvel movie?•ÈÀ
Yes but Sony was in charge of the marketing on that. They have a joint production deal on Spider-Man solo films•ÈÀ
The movie is called into the spider-verse so I don't think they're really spoiling the plot just spoiling which spider people are gonna be in the movie•ÈÀ
Yeah I hope they don't spoil much for Spiderman: Far from Home.•ÈÀ
"@Darceus what? Marvel is pretty bad at this too! Especially in Thor Ragnarok it was awful. Ive honestly stopped watching the 2. Trailers, because they are always full of spoilers.•ÈÀ"
"I feel like there's still plenty that can go on in this film that isn't shown in the trailer, leaving us with just enough surprise in the theater. Also, let's be honest, as long as the presentation is on point, it doesn't matter how much of the plot is given away in the trailer. Case in point: every movie ever made based on a book.P.S. I just love how they incorporate the dot-matrix coloring style. This looks visually stunning. Can't wait to watch it in theaters.•ÈÀ"
Wait so what did they spoil? The characters cuz we alr knew them. The villains? Cuz it's essentially what you expect which is the ultimate universe version of the spiderman rogues gallery. Or is it the plot? Because this is a comic book adaptation movie of the spiderverse comic and we alr kinda know the plot alr. So I don't see your complaint•ÈÀ
This has already came out on netflix ya goofs. And let me tell you it was good!•ÈÀ
They did not show Uncle Ben‰Ûªs death•ÈÀ
So this is the year of Spider-Man•ÈÀ
I saw a trailer about this in 2017 _Ù÷Ğ•ÈÀ

Racist white person who is threatened by a story ark that is 10 years old? Lol•ÈÀ
"Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Carol Danvers and Peter Parker are still white... multiple people can be the same superhero. There are multiple Flashes, multiple Green Lanterns (one is black), multiple Blue Beetles etc.•ÈÀ"
"White people: ‰ÛÏWe do not have a race problem‰Û Sees Black people as main characters Also White people: ‰ÛÏwhy are they black? What is this bullshit‰Û? Yep. Definitely no race problem at ALL•ÈÀ"
sevenlift miles has been a thing in the comics for years now. He isn‰Ûªt new.•ÈÀ
"alsofalcon has been a thing for a while, he just took the mantle of Captain AmericaMs Marvel (Kamala Khan) is not black, but racists be racists i guess•ÈÀ"
Miles Morales has been around forever ya fuckin wad•ÈÀ

No this is an entirely different plotline more likely based on the Spider-Verse comics.•ÈÀ
"@Cristiano Ronaldo i agree with you there tbh. His Spiderman was decent, his Peter was Trash. He was too cool, hence completely out of character.•ÈÀ"
Finley Simmons lol no. Try again kid. Maguire was trash•ÈÀ

I‰Ûªm suprised that the 2 characters they revealed in this trailer were Noir and Peni! I‰Ûªm actually disappointed in SP//DR‰Ûªs design a bit•ÈÀ
Yeah I liked the Eva design. But I guess they had to redesign it to fit the movie's style. Neon Genesis isn't exactly a bright and happy tone haha•ÈÀ

Glad Cartoon art work is back and not another computer animation•ÈÀ
"And its not just standard 2D animation either, its super stylized and I love the experimentation with it.•ÈÀ"
It's actually an animation made to render as cartoon art (it allows for more stuff to be done and is probs a lil cheaper and faster)•ÈÀ
"This is actually mostly CGI, but it's done as something truly freaking unique. This is the most beautiful CGI film I've ever seen.•ÈÀ"
You mean...not a weaboo anime cringefest•ÈÀ
It's combination of 2D and 3D•ÈÀ
Dude this is full computer animation. But they use special shaders to make it look like 2D animation. It looks very good tho. Something different than the nice smooth Pixar animation look that dominates the market. Not sure about the cut frames technique they use to make it more look like a classic 2d animation. It kinda annoyed me a but but it is probably better when we get longer camera sequences instead of short jumpcut trailer sequences.•ÈÀ
"@B D exactly, don't get his comment...if u ask me I don't like how it's choppy on purpose...I think it animating more fluid would have been better, they even voice it like yor typical slick and fast cg movie, making that stand out me more...oh well•ÈÀ"

Sjw garbage. Create new characters and stop destroying the core characters that made you successful in the first place. Blue marvel is awrsome. Didnt have to turn thor into a philipino guy to do it. Create new characters.•ÈÀ
kingogkingswoodz new characters? Who?•ÈÀ
None of these characters are new•ÈÀ
Lmfao do you seriously not know who these characters are? Miles Morales has been spider man since like what 2011? And he was first thought of and created in 2008. Literally none of these characters are new _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â these are all original comic book characters•ÈÀ
@NotMyPresident President lol so yes last ten yrs or less is called new. Sorry kiddo but I'd guess your a tween at best if not younger.•ÈÀ
I mean come on man. Miles was first created in 2008. That‰Ûªs 10 years ago. 2008 is not new•ÈÀ
"This guy was probably still finishing school when Miles Morales first appeared in Marvel lmfao. Peter Parker is still white as snow, don't worry. Did people complain when they replaced Hal Jordan and Guy Gardener with John Stewart?•ÈÀ"
"What most white peoples don‰Ûªt realize, is that anyone White, Black, Mexican, can be spider man, but only a white dude can be Parker. There‰Ûªs a huge difference between changing the race of the super hero, and changing the race of the character. That black dude is not Parker. That‰Ûªs Miles Morales.•ÈÀ"
THIS IS AN ALREADY EXISTING CHARACTER YOU FUCKING DIPSHIT. Miles Morales has been around for YEARS now.•ÈÀ

"he doesnt even appear until later, we'll get a cameo probably at the end of the movie•ÈÀ"
"2099 is too cool a universe to cram in here. If this is successful, I expect a sequel where Miles spends a lot of time in the future with Miguel O'Hara•ÈÀ"

What about the 2099 Spider-Man ?•ÈÀ
My guess is that because TECHNICALLY he's from the same universe as Peter they decided to leave him out? Or maybe they're hoping to save him for a sequel or something.•ÈÀ
Ok I need to know who‰Ûªs voicing Spider-Man noir NOW.•ÈÀ
Nicholas Cage•ÈÀ

"Alright I have one big problem with this, I feel like people will think this as a movie just about miles morales, instead it‰Ûªs actually about a bunch of other Spider-Man, which takes away the story that Miles could tell for other spider men, the plot fell more like a one hour special parody then a movie•ÈÀ"

Not sure how I feel about the animation. It's not bad but its so different.•ÈÀ

1:39 did you guys saw the Advanced suit from Spider-Man ps4 behind Aunt May•ÈÀ
that is really the insomniac spider suit from spiderman ps4•ÈÀ
So I guess the rumours are true it is connected to the mcu!•ÈÀ
Mitchell Reilly not really. The insomniac game is just another Spider-Man from a different universe like all of them here•ÈÀ
@Mmm Ghool but the way there going with it is that its Spider-Man's suits and hideout so possibly it might be the same peter just in the future.•ÈÀ
"Mitchell Reilly wrong. It‰Ûªs just because in the multiverse movie There‰Ûªs probably This Peter we see who I‰Ûªd assume is Toby‰Ûªs Spider-Man with that train scene, then Spider-Man PS4 with the advanced suit, and maybe even tom Holland‰Ûªs and Garfield‰Ûªs. I doubt this is connected to the MCU but just throws Easter eggs to all the Spider-Man we‰Ûªve had threw the years.•ÈÀ"
"Considering there's currently an ongoing comic called Spider-geddon (a sequel to the Spider-verse comic where the multiverse Spideys fought Morlun and the Inheritors), I wonder if this movie has any connection to the comic series, especially seeing that the PS4 Spidey is part of Spider-ggedon.•ÈÀ"
@KrystCyclone spidey ps4 is part of spider-geddon he is a main character so I'm hyped for that comic hope you are to now!•ÈÀ
@Dylan Vincent well you dont know that it could be anything. It might even be all four of those spidey's into one for this movie. So just because we see those suits and scenes doesn't mean it's one character. It is a spider-verse after all.•ÈÀ

"So that's why there's only been like what two trailers? Cause the rest of this film, it's story and characters along with mashing far to many spider man versions besides Spider pig :) is garbage, huge disappointment with to many spider men for a good story play out. Man I'm disappointed I was looking forward to this :(, and why Christmas for a release?Also... Why does Peter look like he's a recovering drug addict? Or a alcoholic•ÈÀ"

"This it something I will buy. They need to start making Spiderman movies like this. Don't get me wrong, the live action ones are decent (excluding 3), but animation opens up so many possibilities that even CG can struggle with.•ÈÀ"
"Animation is definitely the way to go for Spider-verse. I mean, look at how it managed to put in these different Spider-men together while incorporating their respective styles. The cartoony Spider-Ham, the 1940s look of Noir (look closely at the model, the texture is something like from an old comic) and the anime inspired Peni Parker.•ÈÀ"

"You aren't a true Spiderman fan if you don't know about Miles Morales... look to all the people who are saying ""WHY IS HE BLACK!? NOT GONNA SEE THIS!"" do your goddamn research, Miles Morales is part of the Spiderman comics, he basically took the mantle after Peter parker died. There now quit your whining.•ÈÀ"
They‰Ûªre normies that have never even read one comic.•ÈÀ
"OneEyedGhoulX there's no comments saying that, fucking weeb•ÈÀ"
Nobody says so and literally anyone who sees the news knows that. Calm down you're not special•ÈÀ
I haven‰Ûªt seen a single person complaining about that. In fact I‰Ûªve seen more comments complaining about the complaining than any actual complaining about Miles•ÈÀ
OneEyedGhoulX r/gatekeeping•ÈÀ
"The trailer explains it pretty well to anyone who isn't familiar with the spider-verse. If anyone's still confused, they just haven't seen the trailer lol•ÈÀ"
I haven‰Ûªt seen any comments like that for this trailer but I saw SO MANY on he first trailer it was gross•ÈÀ
"OneEyedGhoulX he‰Ûªs my favorite Spider-Man, if u look at my comic book collection it‰Ûªs 25% miles 25% rocket and groot and 50% everything venom•ÈÀ"
I agree with you but i dont like your anime profile...•ÈÀ
"I never really cared for him (maybe love for Peter was too strong), but I'm still excited to see him take lead here.Haven't seen anyone say what you said though. Nice try at gatekeeping.•ÈÀ"
"Miles Morales took the mantle in the ultimate universe, here Peter Parker became spiderman as a teen in contrast to the mainline Spider Man comics and he ended his career a lot more sooner compared to the other spiderman universes•ÈÀ"
True fans could also not know about the character. He came from the Ultimate comics just around a decade ago. Very easy to miss out on him if you only follow the mainstream Spider-Man comic books. He only recently joined the main world.•ÈÀ
Woah the fucking gatekeeping.•ÈÀ
Miles is literally peter parker but half black half Hispanic. Lol•ÈÀ
The only good version of miles is from the insomniac game.•ÈÀ
@Ze Deadly Chef Okay?•ÈÀ
"Screw that, are you protecting your own private little fantacy world. Morales is not mentioned or even refered to in this......HE IS INTRODUCED AS PETER PARKER!......who is now......POOF!  Suddenly black....•ÈÀ"

you probably don't even know who mephisto is.•ÈÀ
When I came upon this comment I hadn't seen any of what you were saying but after scrolling down I started to see the 'why is he black?!' and 'what is this sjw stuff' bullshit comments.•ÈÀ

I was a little disappointed seeing that it wasn‰Ûªt a live action but when I watched the trailer I‰Ûªm actually excited it seems good I‰Ûªd watch•ÈÀ
"Creeper Ferret Making it live action would honestly limit what they could do with the movie. Plus, there needs to be more animated action movies in general.•ÈÀ"

"Also makes sense that Gwen and Peter are very similar in style, since they are basically all in the same universe per se (Gwen is basically where Peter is not bitten and she is, and Miles is the protege of Peter, so just different timelines and such)•ÈÀ"

The animation is just plain beautiful!•ÈÀ
So beautiful!•ÈÀ
the style is beautiful the animation is choppy and painful to watch.•ÈÀ
PheonixKnght no•ÈÀ
"@PheonixKnght It's an artistic choice to give the movie a stop motion feel to really sell the comic book look (as it reflects the choppiness of jumping from panel to panel).•ÈÀ"
I know they chose to do it but its a bad choice.  Like Dragon Prince the choppiness makes it hard to watch which is a shame since the style is amazing. It reminds me of bad claymation movies. Lower frames on CG movies is a way they can cut the render time to a third of what it would be but just comes off as cheap and ugly.•ÈÀ
"@PheonixKnght Agreed, the art style looks amazing, yet like you said the animation is choppy. But I'm pretty sure they aimed for that.•ÈÀ"
"Well i see what you're saying but your wrong. This style and animation is a great choice, I just dont see the bad in this. The look of the characters are great the look of it being a comic is great as well. Also you seem to be saying its bad, do you mean The Amazing Spider-Man movies bad or some idiot who thinks Spider-man is bad.•ÈÀ"
"Well if this is what Marvel is going to do with their animated movies then ill never see any of them. My friends dont like the choppy animation either and will not see it because of the choppy animation so that is eight people off the top of my head that wont see it for this one reason alone. I know it is what they are shooting for but it hurts to watch and i will not watch any movies or shows that do this just like Dragon Prince. I called netflix over the choppiness of that and sent a bug report on it along with voting it down because of the bad animation. That is a show i have been excited about since i heard who was making it but now i wont watch it i would rather read it on a wiki page.Silverboy2 what im saying is all of this looks great but the choppiness of the animation. If they gave it more FPS i would love it and go to see it maybe many times.•ÈÀ"

"Matt Kugelman it's a multi million dollar company reducing quality to reduce the budget they spent getting the rights to spider man.And while they do seem to be making the most of what they have, cutting corners on quality is not a business practice I want to encourage, especially when it's the company making the upcoming sonic the hedgehog movie which I desperatly want to be good.•ÈÀ"
bEtchaos7 The portal master actually Sony‰Ûªs not making the sonic movie anymore paramount is•ÈÀ
bEtchaos7 The portal master also the animation is meant to be choppy to make it more comic book influenced•ÈÀ
"Matt Kugelman riiiiiiiight...It's DEFINITELY not just an excuse, and TOTALLY the ONLY reason for doing so...•ÈÀ"
bEtchaos7 The portal master no it is really is the point other wise all their other recent projects like small foot would go through the same situation in animation•ÈÀ
Matt Kugelman small foot didn't require them to pay millions and millions of dollars to get the rights to yetis•ÈÀ

"Wait, so does the main spider-man come from the Sam Raimi universe because at 0:10 , you can see him stopping the train just like Spider-Man does in the second movie.•ÈÀ"
"I'm pretty sure not since Peter in this movie seems to be using webshooters. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man uses organic webs. It's most likely that this version of Peter comes from a universe where the events of the Raimi movies play out slightly differently.Sort of like how Peni Parker and her mech look very different from their comic counterparts•ÈÀ"
"I don't think so, pretty sure its just a reference to it. It's its own movie, don't go in expecting solid connections to other movies. But I absolutely expect a wink to McGuire, Garfield, and Holland.•ÈÀ"
Nice•ÈÀ
anyone know the song•ÈÀ
He just punched a car. Those he got Superman powers in this movie?•ÈÀ

"Yeah that's disappointing. Never heard of her, and I'm pretty sure she's replacing Japanese Spider-Man with the giant Power Rangers robot. He was the main character I wanted to see in this, it would've been hilarious, but nah we get 5 year-old D.Va instead.•ÈÀ"
"That's Peni Parker. Adopted by her Uncle Ben and Aunt May, pilots SP//dr (the robot you saw her with)•ÈÀ"
"I‰Ûªm confused with the animation style1:06 also, did Spider Man eat his universe?!•ÈÀ"
I think the choppiness is to make it look like a comic book and the different art styles to illustrate these guys are from different dimensions.•ÈÀ
that what a lot of us spider man fans think too•ÈÀ
@Silveyboy2 and do you think the different character designs adds to the effect that these guys are from other dimensions very well?•ÈÀ
"For sure you can tell just by Miles having more detail than peter and gwen but gwen having more that peter, but most of all you can see that spider ham is more of a cartoon.•ÈÀ"

I love how each character has a different animation style. You can really see it in Pen and Spider ham. It really gives the movie a comic book vibe and shows the different dimensions. it's a very unique idea•ÈÀ
"Yeah, even noir is in cel shaded black and white. aka ACTUAL black and white•ÈÀ"
Japanese school girl in the anime style•ÈÀ
Actually Shattered Dimensions did it years ago :)•ÈÀ
"Real Men Like Unicorns sorta. in the big cutscenes they all were realistic, then in gameplay they were all cel shaded except for 2099 i think•ÈÀ"

Aquaman will get rekt by MP and Spiderverse. WB should just ditch the DCEU and make animated films for cinematic release like Sony. DC  animated films are way better than DCEU films.•ÈÀ
What are you talking about? Aquaman will crush this in the box office if it does what I think it will do.•ÈÀ
Yeah Mermen riding sharks with frikken lasers on their heads will totally beat SpiderMan at the Box office... Which one of these universes are you from?•ÈÀ

"The lizard people are from mars and they control the president as a puppet. The lizards take our thumbs so they can make lizard Gucci.

Okay dont get me wrong im still super stoked for this film and im glad that Noir is getting some more mainstream recognition but can we please just get an accurate representation for once.

"agree completely. also don‰Ûªt like this new mask design, since his repurposing his uncle ben‰Ûªs old wwi flight helmet and goggles was such a central part of his origin. at least they actually gave him his coat, though i never was really a fan of the fedora (come on people, he used it in ONE scene solely to hide his mask in public, and it wasn‰Ûªt even his‰ÛÓhe yeeted it into the street as soon as he was done!)i wish they got christopher daniel barnes to do his voice again. noir is in his late teens/early twenties and cage makes him sound old and sort of dopey....i realize that i‰Ûªm coming off as someone who cares way way too much about spider-man noir, and you know what, i‰Ûªm not even going to argue.•ÈÀ"

‰ã¢Black Panther changed the game ‰Û_•ü_ÙÕ»_Ù÷â_Ù_ª•ÈÀ
How?•ÈÀ
Can you please explain how it changed the game.•ÈÀ
No it didn't•ÈÀ
Black panther showed big studios proof that they culd invest in more black lead characters films and get a return why is this  news why tf do you think black panther was such an important film it wasnt cause the hero was black its already been done blade played by wesley snipes were good movies but studios always had their reservations and didnt invest nearly as much as they did compared to bp the movie's success opened doors and is continuing to open doors for up and coming young black actors in hollywood. It was the highest big budget film with an all black cast marvel studio had taken a chance investing that type of money. It doing so well proved that studio need to no longer  worrry about how others audiences would react to the racial demographic of the film it proved the movie wuld be judged on its  content not race ?•ÈÀ
@Djoseph11230 Do you think that Black Panther being part of the MCU had any effect on it's success?•ÈÀ
@Djoseph11230 You ever hear of I am legend?•ÈÀ
@Djoseph11230 just because the cast is all black doesn't matter. In the film industry no one should care about race. You should care about merit or who's best for the job. Not their skin colour because that's also racist.•ÈÀ
"@Sanji Dandelion  bro wil smith was already an established actor long before he was on the big screen he was already know second they were NOT all black casted films and third bp was backed by a Major studio disney, marvel house hold names tell me one of the names of the studios that produced any of the film will smith was in as a lead charactorDont worry ill wait and dont use google either name one from the top of your head•ÈÀ"
"@Zero Cool No if audiences cared about race they wuldnt watch a all black film becuase marvels sticker is on it plus films dont make a 1 billion dollars by having a popular studio behind it also needs word of mouth. Thats the reason it outsold all of marvels others film accept 1st avengers. black panther surpassing all of robert downys ironman films had nothing to do with marvels backing it was the content and thats what movies should be judged on. If only black peeple in the u.s showee up to watch i guarantee it wouldnt even make the 100 mil mark were 14% of the population meaning other people were not only willing to give it a chance but liked it so much that they told there friends and family to go see it. Thats how 1 billion is made or should i say 1.4 billionPlus the studio purposly avoided casting any characters from previous marvel films in bp becuase they wanted it to stand on its own merrits. Samuel jackson had begged marvel to let him be in the movie a cameo anything since it was clearly a black superhero film  and he was already part of the mcu they still told him no . Dont belive me look up his interview•ÈÀ"
"Djoseph11230 are you dumb? Miles has been known to be one of the most loved charectors  not mainstreamingly known, I mean all fans of the Spiderman comics have basically just Ben waiting for a Miles film. spoiler for comics Also in the MCU miles replaced Spiderman after he dies cough cough I don't feel so good•ÈÀ"
@Sanji Dandelion Ok.•ÈÀ
@Sanji Dandelion bro i agree but tell that to the studios their the ones who decide what we watch its their money films making is a business and investors expect a return studios are not in the buisness of making political statment  just money.

"most of them aren't too popular so they are just merging the sorta popular ones into this one. Miles is a pretty well received character (mostly, not entirely) .  However, you claiming  ""I know we all know these characters have existed for like ever"" miles hasn't even been around for 7 years and he was pretty much entirely made because of the whole agenda. Spider-gwen started in 2015 and made her bi/lesbian for that agenda. So, no not really.  Doesn't mean this will be bad though. I'm looking forward to it.•ÈÀ"
@Zyler i know I just don't want it Reviving any negative Sparks like how it did when they first introduced them and I think it went pretty well back then but these subjects are really touchy and hot.•ÈÀ

"Densora Puma People have every right to feel however they want, but when you see any group attacking a fictional film or cartoon over gender or race then that‰Ûªs kinda alarming & sad, considering the progress we‰Ûªve made.•ÈÀ"
"@taciturasa crying more like all the people clamoring for their representation until the point that this stuff has been beaten to death that now they add a black or gay character into literally every form of media and if they don't they are prejudice/misogynist/racist  and hate that community?  That now netflix always tries to have a black /gay character as a focus because if not, people will cry about not being  represented in literally everything? They are replacing ciri (witcher netflix series) with literally any race that isn't white and making her a lead character just for that reason. I'm not saying they shouldn't be represented at all, but it's gotten to crazy heights the past few years that it's almost a sin to have a straight couple in a lot of it and they might as well be asexual.•ÈÀ"
"you're constructing completely fictional oppositional statements, Zyler, in response to some minorities existing in media, Zyler. we're out here running the risk of being killed for our mere existence, Zyler. cry more.•ÈÀ"
"Zyler ‰ÛÏInterview With A Vampire‰Û was about two Gay vampires, The original Harvey ( Two-Face) in Tim Burtons Batman Returns was Black, Billy Dee Williams ... She-Ra was the female version of He-Man etc. Gold Dust from WWE was transgender ...Movies & entertainment have always been this way.•ÈÀ"
what the heck? Running the risk of being killed for your mere existence? like everyone else?  so freaking hyperbolic.  Are you meaning the massively high suicide rate for the mentally unstable? and some existence? it's quite actively a huge part of what's going on that it's literally in every form of media.•ÈÀ
"@radah25 I'm not saying they've had no representation or don't need to exist in media of course, I just mean that it's quite actively everywhere in tons of stuff now and in nearly everything. There's no problem with being represented, of course.  Just saying they are trying to do it for the sake of the race / attention not just making it a sub plot. like when you try to hire someone that is of a specific race and purposefully excluding others, imo, that's a problem to me.  Miles morales is a pretty good character all in all.  A good form of the diversity. and Gold dust isn't transgender? Just was flamboyant really. She-ra wasn't bad though.•ÈÀ"

"Janethan Ricanibante miles was never a PC character Lol, He was simply created due to many kids of color at the time (2011) wanting to see a Spider-Man of their own race. Which I don't see nothing wrong with that..a Spider-Man to relate with. If Stan Lee himself agreed with the creation of miles then..you know marvel done good. Peter's been in the mainstream for like over 50 years..it's about time someone new came up.•ÈÀ"
"@Layiah Ali You just supported my comment lol. You might want to lookup ""reading comprehension"" because yours is whacked.•ÈÀ"
"Janethan Ricanibante actually You're the one who didn't comprehend what I typed.You implied that Peter's character is like that due to some ""PC"" bullshit.While really he's potrayed like that because he's an Experienced Vet.

"@Janethan Ricanibante You really want to start an argument, don't you?•ÈÀ"
"@Layiah Ali You need to compartmentalize your argument because it's all over the place similar to a noob playing a fps who sprays bullets hoping to get a hit.- Just like you said in your own words:""Fans of color wanted someone who they can relate to""  Well if that's not being inclusive to appease certain people then you don't know what pc and affirmative action is.- Peter Parker is presented in this trailer as being jaded and unappealing with a cloud of despair to contrast Mile's enthusiasm, curiosity and vitality.- I'm definitely not watching this SJW nonsense like Star Wars The Last Jedi. No thanks- Anyone who thinks pandering to appeal to certain groups is acceptable is an idiot. Why do you think Black Panther was a huge hit? It wasn't because he was  just black. He was an original not a black version of somebody who's already established.- The White Knights have arrived.

"All the spider-(men?,people) are actually really different from what they are,miles in this movie is really different same with just OG Spider-Man and Gwen‰Ûªs looks,Also they added a new anime......person so everything in this movie is pretty much slightly different versions from Spider-Man comics•ÈÀ"
2:16 the best part so far•ÈÀ
Shoulda let Tobey maguire voice Spider-Man if his scene is in the movie•ÈÀ
or Here on Huit.Re/Chicks•ÈÀ
"I never expected spider ham, and I never would've expected John Mulaney to play him. This was a pleasant surprise.•ÈÀ"
why does Peter look like a recovered alcoholic?•ÈÀ
"Hello The List with Nakeed Womens from your City has been Released heree on this liink : Huit .Re/Chicks The liink will works if you will type it withtout space between Huit and .Re/Chicks ! Enjoys•ÈÀ"
"so peter is tobey maguirecool•ÈÀ"
Something tells me one of these spiderpeople isn't going to last the whole movie...•ÈÀ
Is this a game or movie.•ÈÀ
I am so ready for this movie‰ª´•ü_Ù¥á•ü‰ª´•ü•ÈÀ
Marvel took animation to the next level! Like if you agree•ÈÀ
Wait its a movie? Thought i was a game•ÈÀ
Well technically It created by Sony Pictures Animation (sony still has the rights to Spiderman films)...Marvel doesn't have Animation Division for theatrical films...maybe marvel act as the manager of the source material and also as a consultant...•ÈÀ
Sony*•ÈÀ
Vinodini Karunaharan Like if you hate people that ask for likes•ÈÀ
Not marvel sony•ÈÀ
Stop fishing for likes.•ÈÀ
1:34 Who's that swinging in the background?•ÈÀ
"""Officer, Love You"" - _Ù÷ •ÈÀ"
SPIDER-MAN _ÙÔ•ÈÀ
Is the pig... Zach Braff?•ÈÀ
.....•ÈÀ
Finally. Some love from Tobey Maguire Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
ELITEKILLERZZ YT where ?•ÈÀ
@strikey the first few seconds of the trailer. Where he stops the train and kisses Mary Jane upside down. Those were references to the first Spider-Man movie•ÈÀ
I think he‰Ûªs referring to when the og Spider-Man said ‰ÛÏmy name is peter Parker‰Û and the clips of him stopping the train and kissing mj•ÈÀ
ELITEKILLERZZ YT Tobey Maguire sucks. Just because you were a kid when the movies came out doesn‰Ûªt mean they were good.•ÈÀ
"@TomTheTrain that makes no sense, that's his/her opinion.•ÈÀ"
I do•ÈÀ
"@TomTheTrain theyre good bc sam raimi made them good, look up ""opinion"" in the dictionary and write me a lil report on what it means•ÈÀ"
Of course its also a Sony•ÈÀ
TomTheTrain you probably think Tom Holland is the best Spider Man•ÈÀ
TomTheTrain Spider-Man 2 is still the best Spider-Man•ÈÀ
"TomTheTrain I mean, you play roblox.•ÈÀ"
"TomTheTrain It's not because we was kids when it came out, it's because they were amazing. But you wouldn't know that cause you were still swimming around in your dads balls while we were watching the best spiderman movies that was ever made.•ÈÀ"
TomTheTrain You obviously never watch the Sam Rami Spiderman films. Have you even check the reviews it receive?•ÈÀ
@Buga Voorhees Tom Holland IS the best spiderman. Wait for his other 2 movies.•ÈÀ
Lil LoudPakk just bc he was portrayed as the most accurate Spider Man/Peter Parker doesn‰Ûªt mean he‰Ûªs the best one. Homecoming doesn‰Ûªt compare to Spider Man 2.•ÈÀ
"And the car scene, and the dr octopus•ÈÀ"
Still the one and only spider man•ÈÀ
@Buga Voorhees uhh..yes it does mean he's the best spiderman if he really portrays the most accurate version of him how is that even a argument that's like going against your own opinion_Ù÷â_Ù÷â that was a contradiction how you gonna say hes the most accurate then say he isn't the best one?•ÈÀ
"I kinda disagree with Tobey Mcguire's Spiderman being the ""most accurate"". I do agree that his ""Peter Parker"" was the most accurate but not his ""Spiderman"". I actually felt Andrew Garfield's Spiderman was more accurate but his Peter Parker wasn't. I personally like Tom Holland best because it's a happy medium•ÈÀ"
This trailer just blow my mind.•ÈÀ
"Spiderman: If I don't destroy this collider, None of us will have a home to go home to""(1:58)•ÈÀ"
Im glad the industry is incorporating more black people. Like that oppression was and is still causing conflict nd breeding hatred•ÈÀ
Everything about this movie is looking amazing•ÈÀ
1:05 Why the hell does the food cost that much?•ÈÀ
Those fries must've been reaaaally good.•ÈÀ
Can't wait to see how this animated MCU film holds up.•ÈÀ
YEAH SPIDER GWEN YEAH!!!!•ÈÀ
"Wtf I thought the movie was gonna be real life _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â wait hold up there's gonna be 2 Spider man movies coming out I heard something called far from home, I'm sooo confused•ÈÀ"
UNDEROOOS!!!•ÈÀ
Sony another time making Spiderman worse•ÈÀ
What the actual hell is this•ÈÀ
Wtf do they think their doing•ÈÀ
Marley Francis something smart•ÈÀ
Xbox users are disliket•ÈÀ
100% Sony used office 365 and windows to make this anination happen.•ÈÀ
This is going to suck•ÈÀ

This is a bit strange to say but I've always basically disliked Spider-Man and I want to watch this•ÈÀ
This looks awful•ÈÀ
no u•ÈÀ
no way spiderman is black•ÈÀ
Yooo that Spider-Man popsicle reference got me. I remember being 6 and buying them from the ice cream truck!•ÈÀ
Was that Nick Miller voicing Peter Parker?•ÈÀ

I can't fully express how pumped i am for this movie. It looks absolutely incredible. This might be my new favorite thing•ÈÀ
COOL MOVIE•ÈÀ
I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. Yuri Lowenthal is the best Spider-Man•ÈÀ
"Miles Morales:Officer ...........I love you!!!!Cop dad: Wait! What!??? _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
John Mulaney‰Ûªs Spider-Ham is perfection•ÈÀ
No se supone que SpiderMan va en la prepa?•ÈÀ
I'm sorry roll that back for me. There was a Japanese middle-school version of Spider-girl when!?!!•ÈÀ
Finally miles becomes a Spiderman himself•ÈÀ
To be realky honest i thought it was just going to be about miles peter and qwen butt hey this makes this movie better i think•ÈÀ
I always loved watching animated Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
I was disappointed it isn't Donald Glover but John Mulaney got me....•ÈÀ
Yawn! _Ù÷«_ÙÕ_•ÈÀ
They‰Ûªve done it again•ÈÀ
So...much...YES!•ÈÀ
YESSSSS MILESSSSS•ÈÀ

Is this the voice of nick miller from new girl at the beginning?•ÈÀ
"Nic Cage as Noir, let‰Ûªs go!•ÈÀ"
wait I thought everyone hate Nic cage...•ÈÀ
I think you mean Johnny Blaze.•ÈÀ
"Jon N people loves him,  but his career as an actor is very damaged. He's been in a lot of shitty movies and has become a meme more than an actor, so hear him (just hear) in what it looks like an awesome movie,  makes people hyped myself included :D•ÈÀ"
Awesome.•ÈÀ
This movie is sexy•ÈÀ
"BOTS! BOTS EVERYWHERE!I lied...•ÈÀ"

I love how they put PS4 Spider-Man in the background at 1:38 I hope he's in the actual movie•ÈÀ
1:51 deadpool•ÈÀ
i like this..........but the frame rate hurts me (even tho its deliberate)•ÈÀ
I hope this is somehow connected to the mcu•ÈÀ
Gwen is Pretty :)•ÈÀ
Eww•ÈÀ
Brad Ferdinand meh•ÈÀ
Its prettier in the comics•ÈÀ
Really? I don't like that gap tooth or that hair.•ÈÀ
Shes a bit young in comparison to peter Im a lil confused•ÈÀ
NMS Tr4nquil different universe. The universe she‰Ûªs from probably has a much younger Peter.•ÈÀ
This looks like it‰Ûªs going to be a lot of fun.•ÈÀ
"Not a Miles fan, but this looks promising. The art is what really stands out most•ÈÀ"
Carlos Rodriguez why aren‰Ûªt you a miles fan? Curious.•ÈÀ
Have you read the books?•ÈÀ
Racist? _Ù÷±•ÈÀ
"@Vincent Amadeus He's being 100% racist and his last name is Rodriguez.OH MY GOOOOOOD!!!!!•ÈÀ"
Peter Parker > Miles Morales. The difference is about 50 years worth of character development.•ÈÀ
"@Chumn Li 100% Truth muchacho, but Morales is still better than everyone else in the Spider-Verse. And a good/fun Character.•ÈÀ"
"I'm not a fan because I find most legacy heroes to be lazily written, although Miles is far better than most. He's a decent character, but I feel pandered to whenever a minority assumes the title of a non-minority character without compelling reason. Again, Miles is still leagues better than most. I'd argue his existence is far more justifiable. I just never got into him really because I see myself more in Peter.•ÈÀ"
Zero Cool lmao Doc Ock was a pretty cool character imo•ÈÀ
@Zero Cool im sorry Ben riley would fucking throw down over those words•ÈÀ
Why the animation looks different? Is this a new style?•ÈÀ
Nic cage as Noir is the best thing ever•ÈÀ
"John mulaney as spider ham...Ledgendary 11/10•ÈÀ"

From the  people who did the emoji movie•ÈÀ
"It's not!, they're obviously the same company, but its not the same people, that's like saying Bowfinger and The Bourne Identity were done by the same people just because  it's the same studio•ÈÀ"

Love the art style•ÈÀ

GASP! is that nick from new girl?!•ÈÀ
In what bizarre universe would I actually excited to see a Spider-Man movie from Sony???? Oh wait....it's this one!!!! Pena Parker and her Sp/DR robot are in this??? I had no idea! I am BEYOND hyped for this now. Spider-Ham looks goofy as hell tho.•ÈÀ

Into the Spider-Non-Binary-Gender-Fluid-Verse.•ÈÀ

@MAD Alchemist Oops forgot to add that part.•ÈÀ
Does it have too?•ÈÀ
"The Spiderman PS4 video game has no relation with the comics. Some characters stripped, but a completely different story.I'm assuming this movie will take some core aspects from the comics, but it will be new enough to be perfectly distinct from it's predecessor•ÈÀ"

Pizza time _Ù¥•ÈÀ
nah lmao•ÈÀ
Nicolas Cage is a Spider-Man from a universe based out of film noir.•ÈÀ
Tobey Maguire is the second best. Tom Holland is #1 as he nails both Peter and Spiderman perfectly. Tobey is a good Peter but not a good Spiderman. Andrew is an eh Spiderman and a terrible Peter Parker.•ÈÀ
And Spider-Man can't be black...•ÈÀ
Obviously the best Spiderman is Supaidaman!•ÈÀ
@Luis Alberto PÌ©rez NÌÁjera Huh? Why do you sound so stupid•ÈÀ
Lol How can I change your mind? It's your opinion•ÈÀ
"Best portrayal of Peter Parker, yes, only Peter Parker though•ÈÀ"
Well this is basically in Tobey Spidey's universe...so yeah...•ÈÀ
PS4 definitely had the best Spidey•ÈÀ
PokemonTrainer77 Peter's not 14 tho lol•ÈÀ
Obviously this movie was created for butthurt minorities that just spread hatred.•ÈÀ
Thats a big yup from me•ÈÀ
That was good. Will be watching this on release.•ÈÀ

Dang this movie cant run 60 fps•ÈÀ
I wish they would of used Miles Morales for the MCU version just cause we've already had multiple Peter parkers•ÈÀ
JR Smith's Henny Bottle he was mentioned in homecoming.•ÈÀ
"He was confirmed as a known character in the universe, dont know if we will ever see a portrayal though•ÈÀ"
Puddle of Adrenaline he probably will...a new decade is arriving in less than a year from now. So..maybe•ÈÀ
JR Smith's Henny Bottle *Miles•ÈÀ
JR Smith's Henny Bottle honestly•ÈÀ
"Layiah Ali Maybe if Marvel re gains the rights to all of the Spider-Verse than maybe, I mean look at Ghost Rider is now owned by Disney but they still only keep him on AoS.•ÈÀ"
"Agreed. There's been too many Parkers on the silver screen. Seeing a live-action depiction of Miles with his suit would have been neat. Because so far the best Peter Parker has been Tobey Maguire. Maybe Nic Cage would make a great performance, but I dunno if that Spider-Man is also called Peter Parker.•ÈÀ"
Anyone else more excited for this movie than Venom?•ÈÀ
MistressOnABeat they both look really good•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
"how about no ""than"" ? and add ""same""•ÈÀ"
No•ÈÀ
This movie is perfect for freaks and minorities.•ÈÀ
Nahhh•ÈÀ
@Luis Alberto PÌ©rez NÌÁjera Huh? That makes zero sense•ÈÀ
no•ÈÀ
"Don't listen to those nos, yes yes YES•ÈÀ"
Will watch both•ÈÀ
I'm more excited for this than the next mcu Spiderman movie•ÈÀ
Absolutely not•ÈÀ
@Saiyan Prince don't get me wrong I like Tom Holland as Spiderman but I'd like a movie that is entirely Spiderman not just another movie to add to a franchise•ÈÀ
Luis Alberto PÌ©rez NÌÁjera You‰Ûªre a minority Pancho.•ÈÀ
That stance at the end though looks very familiar_Ù_Ó Black Panther anyone?•ÈÀ
It's definitely a nice little easter egg for Black Panther.•ÈÀ

MT Customs I‰Ûªve watched this trailer several times ... and I‰Ûªm still hyped.•ÈÀ
"Im almost 40 years old and loved the 90s Spidey TAS. Objectively, this looks like Fortnite just because it wants to appeal to that demo instead of being original art.•ÈÀ"
Twitter market research has effectively killed creativity and risks for companies.•ÈÀ
"Also, they knew they had to show the white Spidey, otherwise white people wouldn't rush to watch it. They want to get rid of whites, yet minorities are not the ones rising the box office numbers beyond $400 million worldwide.•ÈÀ"

Still hoping That Takuya Yamashiro/Tokusatsu Spider-Man gets a cameo or appears in the sequel. But we have Peni Parker so that‰Ûªs cool too.•ÈÀ
Why is nobody talking about Nicholas cage as SPIDER MAN NOIR! It was a match made in heaven!•ÈÀ

"""It's beginning to look a lot like a nondenominational holiday."" From Spiderman.•ÈÀ"
#Spiderpig Simpson predicted it•ÈÀ
Peter Porker Spider Ham was around way before the Simpsons movie came out...•ÈÀ
SD Brand Wow really? I learned something new today•ÈÀ
Where are the rest of the frames? It's like the animation is running at 16 or 20fps instead of the normal film rate of 24. It's really jarring.•ÈÀ
Wtf a black spiderman•ÈÀ
Not sure if you guys noticed but Spider-Ham is John Mulaney.•ÈÀ
I usually hate Marvel but the only thing I like is Spider-Man because he‰Ûªs original. Marvel didn‰Ûªt copy him from dc. He‰Ûªs a true hearted character and he‰Ûªs also the first youngest comic book superhero back in the 50‰Ûªs. Such a awesome character. Much love for this movie :)))•ÈÀ
But spider-man wasn't created till the 60's and there were other younger super heroes that pre-date him like Robin and Captain Marvel/Shazam that came out in the 40's•ÈÀ
Matt Zeilmann oh sorry my bad 60‰Ûªs* and really? I‰Ûªve read a dozen times that Spider-Man is the first youngest superhero from the comics. Shazam is kinda complicated since it‰Ûªs a kid that turns into a grown man but that‰Ûªs a good point•ÈÀ
"@Shady Kermit I would he was probably the first to be a young superhero and actually have it mean something. Like Robin was a kid but never really acted like one, he would never really go to school or have a life outside of being a superhero unlike spiderman he was probably the first where being so young actually meant  something.•ÈÀ"
Sony is really spoiling us Spider-Man fans this year•ÈÀ
Where's Spider-Man 2099???•ÈÀ
I wish it was just about miles•ÈÀ
This came out nowhere•ÈÀ
Yet another Spider-Man movie?!•ÈÀ
Deadpool at 1:50•ÈÀ
Please release in telugu•ÈÀ
"Enserio SONY PICTURES un hombre araÌ±a negro•ÈÀ"
Ight I was excited for this movie but tbh i don‰Ûªt know how good this is going to be after this•ÈÀ
When she said Gwen Stacy it gave me chills•ÈÀ
Can't wait.•ÈÀ
So we are getting a black superman and spiderman? _Ù_£•ÈÀ
Do animals talk in this dimension coz I don't wanna freak him out.... LMAO•ÈÀ
Also spiderman PS4 at 1:39 behind aunt may•ÈÀ
Have you ever saw the top comment and you say why dident i think of that?•ÈÀ
Wait so will this ‰ÛÏPeter Parker‰Û be the Sam raimi Spider-Man?•ÈÀ
What•ÈÀ
"Bruh, your gonna add spiderpig, but your not gonna add SPIDERMAN 2099 OR SCARLET SPIDER, _Ù÷¤•ÈÀ"
I saw Spider-Man noir and I was in•ÈÀ
this looks so cute???•ÈÀ
Somebody doesn't know when to use question marks....•ÈÀ
SD Brand // i put them there on purpose _Ù___Ù_‰Û‰ªÛ•ü  you really thought you were doing something•ÈÀ
@doyogns but what was the purpose? To not make sense?•ÈÀ
Those references tho•ÈÀ
This is Day 1 for me at least 5 times. I LOVE SPIDERMAN!!!•ÈÀ
"1:39 SPIDER MAN PS4 SUIT BEHIND PETERHyperventilation Intensifies•ÈÀ"
Yes! Spider-ham! Yeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!!!! sorry he's my favorite Spider-person•ÈÀ
Person? He's a pig....•ÈÀ
"@SD Brand well you get what I mean, right?•ÈÀ"
The popsicle bit is pretty accurate•ÈÀ
I loved those popsicles...•ÈÀ
Looks better than Home coming.•ÈÀ
Why they black•ÈÀ
Miles Morales is black in the comics•ÈÀ
D C oh ok thanks•ÈÀ
mr stark this meme is not to good•ÈÀ
But why 30 FPS?  Is it a Playstation exclusive?•ÈÀ
2:30 ...Black Panther reference??•ÈÀ
oh god I think I'm more excited for this than Avengers 4 or Captain Marvel at this point XD•ÈÀ
"The 4.1k dislikes are from the opposite dimension, where dislikes are actually likes.•ÈÀ"
They had me at Nicholas Cage as Spiderman Noir and John Mulany as Spider Ham•ÈÀ
"The last few trailers only got me mildly excited, but after seeing this...I‰Ûªm on the hype train!•ÈÀ"
"1:27 is she a reference of gwen from the comics (the color scheme reminds me her but gwen in the comics was white and pink) I might be thinking about gwen pool idk•ÈÀ"
"She's Spider-Gwen, a version of Gwen Stacy from another universe that was bitten by the spider instead of Peter•ÈÀ"
Snoi Med oooh ok yup I remember her now thx for the info I just heard the name gwen then saw her attire and got confused•ÈÀ
"Pink and white is Gwenpool. Spider-Gwen is more white, black, pink and blue.•ÈÀ"

So is spider pig just a simpsons reference?•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
not for me...i hate when too many characters have the same powers...Like How Arrow had too many Archers and The Flash has too many Speedsters•ÈÀ
Imagine how awesome it would be Tobey macguire was voicing peter Parker•ÈÀ
PENI PARKER IS MY NEW WAIFU•ÈÀ
the art style is all over the place•ÈÀ
There Needs To Be A Episode Where Miles Just Meets The Avengers•ÈÀ
I really wish the older Spider-Man is voiced by Tobey but overall it looks great! Certainly a step up from The Emoji Movie and Venom!•ÈÀ
The Real Delphox 616 hold up you haven‰Ûªt even seen venom yet boi I‰Ûªm sooo hyped for that fockin movie you have no idea•ÈÀ
Tobey doesnt VA/act anymore•ÈÀ
Denki Kaminari. Why?•ÈÀ
Tobey voiced adult Tim in The Boss Baby though.•ÈÀ
Did you just call venom bad?•ÈÀ
Oof no. Never Tobey.•ÈÀ
I would rather it be voice by Christopher Daniel Barnes (the 90‰Ûªs spider man) grew up watching that show•ÈÀ
"_ÙÓ« Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse fiIm avaiIabIe here: t.co/3Hodi5yZnU Unglaublicher film! Sehr zu empfehlen, es auszuprobieren!•ÈÀ"
The Real Delphox 616 nope nope nope venom hasn‰Ûªt even came out yet stop it•ÈÀ
This dude just called venom bad and its not even out. Smh foh bro•ÈÀ
There are no dark skin black girls in the movie so it should be worth watching. Its good the director aint a sjw and understands black girls that have darker skin than Nicki Minaj are ugly and irrelevant•ÈÀ
The Real Delphox 616 missed opportunity•ÈÀ
The Real Delphox 616 I FOUND YOU HAHAHAHA YOU USED TO TRASH ON DC ON COMICBOOKCAST LOL IM THE WITCHER OF COMICS_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â I've been looking for the O.Gs for a while bro•ÈÀ
"@Mr. Woods I remember you. You had a Naruto image as your profile,  that explains your lack of tastes!•ÈÀ"
@The Real Delphox 616 YES OMG I MISSED YOU _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
@The Real Delphox 616 Oh man I missed fighting you. That was really the highlight of my day•ÈÀ
@The Real Delphox 616 Glad you're here supporting Spider-Man. One thing we can agree on is Spider-Man is amazing•ÈÀ

"Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig, does whatever a Spider-Pig does.•ÈÀ"
"I think it was an actual comic book comedy line that came out, i believe, roughly after the Simpsons•ÈÀ"
"@Silver Pop Nah, according to Wikipedia, that character originated in the Eighties.•ÈÀ"
Spider-pig had his own comic way before any Simpsons•ÈÀ
*Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
Not from the Simpsons.. Comic way before that.•ÈÀ
Lol people know nothing about marvel!•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham originated from some parody comics by Dave Simm. His real name is Peter Porker.•ÈÀ
Lmao! Great now im singing the Simpson's  spider pig song. Is anyone else singing that song?•ÈÀ
Justin Natasmai its in the disney XD cartions•ÈÀ

I love the idea of an old seasoned Peter Parker that looks like a trailer dweller under his mask.•ÈÀ
it is going to be legendary•ÈÀ
Porkyman•ÈÀ
So jam packed with refrences most of will get like the Rami Films and the other Spider-Men. Art style is amazing. Make me bankrupt already•ÈÀ

Way to copy the LEGO Batman movie with those Raimi movie/other pop culture references... Alfred did the same thing where he listed off events from all the other Batman movies•ÈÀ
"With that logic, wouldn't LEGO Batman be copying Deadpool with the comic book references? Just enjoy the movie for what it is without complaining.•ÈÀ"
As if the Lego Batman movie was the first to do that....•ÈÀ
King Kaizer you think Deadpool was the first movie to have pop culture references??•ÈÀ
SD Brand tell me a movie that came out before LEGO Batman that had the same type of self referencing•ÈÀ
@FlickTalk why would I do that if it has already been done here?•ÈÀ
"@FlickTalk I said ""With your logic""?And of course not, that's stupid•ÈÀ"

The animation style is simply unique & priceless!!! _ÙÔ•ÈÀ
i agree just lovely especially when gwen stacy pops in•ÈÀ
It's like a comic book•ÈÀ
"Yes, it‰Ûªs very unique and captures the feel of a comic book perfectly•ÈÀ"
That's one way of putting it. I hope they didn't spend much on it.•ÈÀ
"Might just be the lack of other shots, but Peni Parker seems to be animated with an even flatter cell-shading than the others to make her look like she's from an anime!•ÈÀ"
Seems a bit laggy to me tough•ÈÀ
"Sony really upped their game from their crappy animated movies (Despicable Me, Hotel Transylvania, Emoji Movie, etc.)•ÈÀ"

Despicable me it's not a Sony movie is a Universal and Illumination movie.•ÈÀ

Why am is so ready for this•ÈÀ
What‰Ûªs it rated•ÈÀ
I can't wait for this movie!!!‰÷ •ÈÀ
"Sees spider noir, proceeds to cum•ÈÀ"
So this is really cool and all...BUT THEY SHOWED TOO MUCH GODDAMMIT!!!! I was content with the last trailer cause it didn't go to mutch into the story/plot and I was excited to see what was gonna happen. This trailer almost spoils everything!•ÈÀ
"ApexKnight No it doesnt•ÈÀ"
"@VenomIsSoCute Yeah It does. Peter Parker and his alternate versions all fall into Miles universe and they have to work together to destroy the collider while also teaching Miles how to be spiderman. 10 bucks that scene when he talks to his dad as spiderman is at the very end. I'm still gonna see this movie, but whoever put this trailer together is a fool.•ÈÀ"
"Couldn't let  Miles hav a solo movie..........Maat Hotep•ÈÀ"
Now I know that Miles Morales isn‰Ûªt the only main character here•ÈÀ
Where is Tom Holland•ÈÀ
This movie is just like this game Spider-Man Unlimited because it shows different Spider-Man and Spider-Woman in Different Universes•ÈÀ
"""Alright is everyone here?""""We're missing Spider-Hitler""""Okay, everyone's here""•ÈÀ"
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY SONY!!!•ÈÀ
What happened to Tom Holland-•ÈÀ
min suga Became ash?•ÈÀ
At least he has a dad....the other one can‰Ûªt even keep his uncle•ÈÀ
I literally don‰Ûªt think I could be more excited for this movie. Christmas can‰Ûªt get here fast enough! The only thing that could make this movie better is if Spider-man 2099 was in it. But the cast as it is rn is still fantastic. Plus we have Nick Cage voicing Spider-man Noir...simply amazing.•ÈÀ
2 months•ÈÀ
"INSANE Nero That‰Ûªs still too long, I need this movie now•ÈÀ"
"Yeah hope we get more clips of this dude. And hey, maybe this'll be good enough for a sequel with more Spider-men!•ÈÀ"
"So you ""literally"" don't think you can think something?Stop saying ""literally"" for emphasis just because you hear other people do it.It makes you sound literally stupid.•ÈÀ"
I'm hopeful we see more Spider-Men and that they're keeping them as a surprise for the movie•ÈÀ
"TemGoBoom Yeah, I really hope this movie does well enough to justify a sequel. Would love to see a rotating cast of all the the different Spider-men in each of the possible sequels, possibly keeping Miles, or even Spider-Gwen, as the ‰Û÷main‰Ûª characters in each movie.•ÈÀ"
"Manuel David Rendon Acevedo Maybe, but if they introduce more Spider-men they run the risk of bloating the cast and having too many characters. I think it‰Ûªd be smarter if they saved more Spider-men for any possible sequels, maybe tease them in this movie, but the six we have rn are great and diverse. I want to see as many Spider-men as possible, trust me, but I don‰Ûªt want the movie to be ‰Û÷overcrowded‰Ûª either.•ÈÀ"
I only came here for Nic Cage•ÈÀ
Im gonna need that Spiderman christmas album tho•ÈÀ
Spider-Man cries after he hears that she‰Ûªs Gwen Stacy but then cries even harder when she says she‰Ûªs from another dimension.•ÈÀ
Say me the music trailer pleaseeeeee•ÈÀ
I thought that the last scene was wakanda. :3•ÈÀ
So you kill spiderman in infinity war.... AND THEN YOU MAKE THIS LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED?????•ÈÀ

this animation deserves to be seen in IMAX•ÈÀ
Didn‰Ûªt his dad die•ÈÀ

How come no one is commenting about Noir?!•ÈÀ
I hate Gwen‰Ûªs hair but I love her still•ÈÀ
Cools _Ù÷_•ÈÀ
The only thing this movie is missing is a cameo from Toei‰Ûªs Spider-Man•ÈÀ
"Wow. They went as far as to give Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker different art styles.On a side note, the Kingpin is absurdly fat and I can't look at him without bursting into laughter.•ÈÀ"
Wait is this the sequel to the game?•ÈÀ
LOL No because in The game Peter Parker is in he's 20s•ÈÀ
can y‰Ûªall sub to me please?•ÈÀ
https://youtu.be/JwncAQurlqk•ÈÀ

"God, I'm gonna love this movie. I can already tellAlso, why does Spider Pig sound like JonTron at 1:40•ÈÀ"
Why in the world marvel did why is there like 5 spider hero In this movie•ÈÀ
1:38 Me watching this trailer right when I thought I understood the plot from the first 2 trailers•ÈÀ
"Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig Does whatever a Spider-Pig Does.Can he swing from a web?No he can‰Ûªt, he‰Ûªs a pig, look out, it‰Ûªs Spider-Pig!•ÈÀ"
Gucci Versace spider ham•ÈÀ
"I thought this was the spiderman game for xbox as a troll_ÙÕÛ Also I have no idea if this movie is worth watching.. On the bright side, Miles Morales has the role as a main character!•ÈÀ"
"Spider Ham is just a great joke itselfOhhh and by the way there is a great easter egg at 1:39•ÈÀ"
What Easter Egg  I haven't seen it yet•ÈÀ
@Zachary Lee 1995 spider-man ps4 suit•ÈÀ
"Hel yes, I saw it, I saw it back there!•ÈÀ"
Best Spider-Man Into the SpiderVerse Movie Trailer ever•ÈÀ
Why do we have to have like 20 billion spider man movies•ÈÀ
I guess it's always been like that. In the comics there's like a hundred different Spider-Man continuities.•ÈÀ
"Does anybody else hate it, when someone comments thank you for so many likes & it‰Ûªs not even that many likes _Ù_á_ÙÈ‰Û‰ªÛ•ü•ÈÀ"
Is that nior Spiderman?•ÈÀ
Yea•ÈÀ
"The real Mac Ter YEET•ÈÀ"

3.8k are multiple Green Goblin and J. Jonah Jameson hateful dislikes from the multiverse.•ÈÀ
Screw them!•ÈÀ
I don't know how I feel about this. I'll wait for Redbox•ÈÀ
I thought moonlight was #1 trending•ÈÀ
Spiderman is not black•ÈÀ
In another universe he is•ÈÀ
No such thing exists•ÈÀ
That‰Ûªs the whole part of the movie. There are other universes with different Spider Men•ÈÀ
I was hoping for a spider-ham solo movie... this‰Ûªll do for now•ÈÀ
Thumbs up if you loved the USPS tag label at the end....I sure did.•ÈÀ
I love how they break the 4rth wall in this movie and just make fun of how many spider men there are•ÈÀ
NIKE Advertising their Shoes at 2:40 at least it isn't as bad as the Bud Light Advertising scene in Transformers the Last Knight. lolz!!!•ÈÀ
Do you think I'll like this movie even though I've never once opened a comic book?•ÈÀ
Yeah looks pretty accessible•ÈÀ
Is that the spider pig joke from the simpsons movie or is there really a spider pig from one of the comic universe? Man i need to brush up on my spiderman knowledge•ÈÀ
There is really a Spider Ham in the cannon marvel universe•ÈÀ
Yeah he is from the comics from a universe where essentially every Marvel character is a Looney Toon•ÈÀ
"This is kinda the problem with introducing multiple dimensions in marvel's superhero films. The average movie-going audience doesn't understand what's going on when they have characters as absurdist as ""SpiderHam."" This concept should have been eased into instead of throwing the audience headfirst into the idea of parallel universes with multiple spidermen. It's going to be confusing for people who aren't as familiar with that concept.•ÈÀ"
Not to say this movie is going to be bad at all. It looks pretty good at the moment. Loving the little references. Just hoping it makes sense from a story telling perspective. Here's to being hopeful.•ÈÀ
Yep there's a Spider-Ham in the comics and his real name is Peter Porker.•ÈÀ
Iqbal Satrio Nindito Spider Ham is in fact a Canon spider•ÈÀ
Best part is Spiderham is played by John Mulaney•ÈÀ
"Good lord, he is actually canon indeed! I actually googled him and found the story and his universe (captain americat, lol) interesting indeed. I reckon this movie will be just fine, sure some light fan like myself will need to google the reference every now and then, but hey, the more the people will know about Spiderman universe the better!•ÈÀ"
"Spider-Ham is canon and was created in the 1980s. In his universe, all the heroes are animals. Peter Porker is pretty funny.•ÈÀ"
"Iqbal Satrio Nindito Tbh I think the strangest is Peni Parker and SP//dr, the little girl and giant mech she controls with her mind•ÈÀ"
since he‰Ûªs stuck in another dimension...i guess he‰Ûªs Spider-Man: Far from Home...eh? EH?•ÈÀ
get out >.>•ÈÀ
Rivyn Daniel LOL•ÈÀ
@Rivyn Daniel no that's Jordan Peele bro•ÈÀ
Meh•ÈÀ
Max lol I forgot about that•ÈÀ
Yes. What?•ÈÀ
lol•ÈÀ
I'll show you the door•ÈÀ
"Nah, but those Shattered Dimensions are the plot.•ÈÀ"
It could be called Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions•ÈÀ
Make the move faster plz i will give 1m•ÈÀ
"2:15-2:20 At first I was thinking that it was super cute and funny but then I remembered the aragogue and now I find it super creepy and now i'm a little sad because he's dead and all... so yeah, i can't wait to see!! _Ù÷_•ÈÀ"
Man this movies gonna be awesome•ÈÀ
O song dis knit picking but in the sam ramy movies Peter wasn‰Ûªt talking to Mary Jane in his Spider-Man outfit wen doc oc attacked them•ÈÀ
I think they're exaggerating those scenes as a joke. He didn't punch the car either but it's way funnier thay way.•ÈÀ
"They added NOIR SPIDER MAN, 100% better•ÈÀ"
WTF did I just watched•ÈÀ
I'M SO READY•ÈÀ
"Sony I think in Amazing Spiderman vs 6 Siniester, no this•ÈÀ"
A BLACK SPIDER-MAN! i'm digging it. oh and God bless trump and Kenya no joke•ÈÀ

Who's the girl that said hello•ÈÀ
That voice actor for spider man is like the worst person they could pick•ÈÀ
spider-pig!!•ÈÀ
"Freaking Peni Parker and Peter Porker (Spider-Ham)!? This may just be the best Spider-Man film to date, never thought I see these two.•ÈÀ"
I wanna see this movie so bad•ÈÀ
Is this  nick from NEW GIRL•ÈÀ
Is this worth watching?•ÈÀ
I'm down with everything except gwen's hair•ÈÀ
Yeah looks weird•ÈÀ
Holy frick I already like this!•ÈÀ
"It's probably just Noir, but did I see bat man? No. No. Sorry. Any way, this should be lit! I really want this sooner.•ÈÀ"
Yee•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm actually getting hyped for this•ÈÀ
I honestly like the old trailer better but this still seems good•ÈÀ
"Thoes song names are amazing:1.Spidey it's cold outside 2.Swinging around the mistletoe3.Silent night(Your welcome)4. Joy to the wrold (That I just saved)5.Spidey the snowman6.It's beging to look a lot like a non-denominational holiday•ÈÀ"
Skyro Gaming and ave Maria•ÈÀ

How do you misspell 'you're' when the correct spelling is right in front of you..•ÈÀ
Fisk looks like a person from wal-e•ÈÀ
Thanks now I don‰Ûªt have to watch the movie lol•ÈÀ
This must be Sonys way of apologising for screwing us up with the emoji movie by giving us spider man movie•ÈÀ
#spiderman is the best•ÈÀ
"Ok gwen stacy, SHE'S FREAKIN HOT•ÈÀ"
"Wait, this is a Movie in Cinemas?•ÈÀ"
Spiderpig!•ÈÀ
"Also who thinks Peter will sacrifice himself at the climax of the movie, in order to stay with the origin of Miles?•ÈÀ"
Yo my boi got the Chicago 1's on•ÈÀ
WHERE‰ÛªS MIGUEL O‰ÛªHARA•ÈÀ
"What happened to making something fresh and new?!Instead they continue to beat a dead horse. Spider man franchise died after Toby McGuire.•ÈÀ"
0:10 Spider-Man 2 references!!!•ÈÀ
Miles dad looks like the fortnite default skin _Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
I'm hyped•ÈÀ
Now this is what u call a must see movie•ÈÀ
Looks pretty good except I dont like the half shaved haircut Gwen has. I hope they don't make her into some retarded feminist.•ÈÀ
Do animals talk in this dimension cause i dont wanna freak them out_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
I'd rather just see spider pig in a porno...•ÈÀ
"I'd rather you watch this and consider what he says. https://youtu.be/b4TMuee7Ir8:)•ÈÀ"
Which villains were introduced in this?•ÈÀ
"Middle aged peter with a five o'clock shadow is really bugging me more than it should, especially since he is supposed to be around Gwen's age...•ÈÀ"
Francisco Martinez in Spider-Gwen‰Ûªs world Peter dies. Peter is 30ish in this movie.•ÈÀ
LLLLIIIITTTTT•ÈÀ
I've got my eyes on u Sony! I don't trust you as far as I can throw u•ÈÀ
"I love how they brought in every aspect and ""piece"" that they could, into this trailer....From Peter Parker's love interest, to a soggy popsicle, to an anime chick that controls a robot, etc.... XD•ÈÀ"
Dumb•ÈÀ
"Hmm, is the graphics meant to be watched with 3D glasses? Because it's very similar.•ÈÀ"
That in association with marvel studios it's the only way they make their movies from now•ÈÀ
This trailer gave me cancer.•ÈÀ
Stop making Spider-Man movies - it‰Ûªs ridiculous•ÈÀ
All the people that are into memes will understand 1:03•ÈÀ
OMG YES JOHN MULANEY•ÈÀ
This movie looks sick definitely gonna watch it•ÈÀ
This is fucking awesome•ÈÀ
This movie‰Ûªs gonna make me cry by the end of it huh?•ÈÀ
I really wanted to see Spider-Man 2099•ÈÀ
So the spiderman in this movie not from the ultimate universe is the rami(probably spelling wrong) spiderman•ÈÀ
Yes we get another Black superhero wakanda forever•ÈÀ
Well to get technical he's actually bi-racial African-American on his dad's side and Hispanic on his mother's side.•ÈÀ
Well the movie will be good for sure•ÈÀ
@Ethan M Oh yeah no doubt I was especially sold on the John Mulaney Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
HE looks like Tay-K•ÈÀ
SPIDER-HAAAAAM!!!!•ÈÀ
Dam 10 million views in 10 hours•ÈÀ
"Spider hamSpider hamOnly eats....... UmSpider ham.•ÈÀ"
Spiderman's black???????•ÈÀ
In another universe he is•ÈÀ
"Search Up BBS ROME and listen to his song, you won‰Ûªt regret it.•ÈÀ"
I don‰Ûªt understand why this is a Animated this would be a perfectly fine non-animated movie as well•ÈÀ
"Not gonna lie, I‰Ûªm glad that John Mulaney is spider-ham•ÈÀ"
Bony Boberts John Mulaney as Spider Ham is one of the many great things about this movie.•ÈÀ
I never knew I needed this•ÈÀ
Do animals talk in this Dimension? cause I don't want to freak him out•ÈÀ
1:46 was that the mirror dimension? Can the MCU reach into this universe?•ÈÀ
"Who's voicing Peter? Not gonna lie... Not really a fan. He just sounds ""off""•ÈÀ"
"Not really, he seems like a very tired, old Peter Parker.Maybe we'll get some background as why he's so....not the Peter Parker we all know.•ÈÀ"
The guy from New Girl. Playing the same guy.•ÈÀ
CantankerousDave Yeah friggin Nick Miller aka Jake Johnson.•ÈÀ
Sounds like a normal guy.•ÈÀ
I wish it was Toby Maguire or Josh Keaton they have the best Spider-Man voices•ÈÀ
theres a little japanese spidergirl bye what is sony on•ÈÀ
K yah I'm so watching that but I'm more curious as to who's gonna go watch Mr. Glass?•ÈÀ
"4th wall breaks not even 20 seconds in, Deadpool‰Ûªs got to watch out for the underdog.•ÈÀ"
"Life long Spider-Man fan.  I'm 50 now.  This is, I'm just not sure.  Spider-Ham is cool to see though.•ÈÀ"
Okay. THIS is the kinda stuff we want to see. Not feckin' Emoji Movies. Not whatever your version of Minions was. THIS. THIIIIIIIIIS. This is why Disney hasn't bought you out yet.•ÈÀ
Because they can't•ÈÀ
I wish they would but unfortunately it means monopoly•ÈÀ
"Eh, not even Minions deserve that kind of comparison with the Emoji Movie. The latter really is just a special kind of dreadful from Sony. Even to the point where other movies like Cars 2, Chicken Little, and Shark Tale are starting to look a whole lot better by contrast. I do have more hope in this movie than Venom though and this movie could only be their potential fluke.•ÈÀ"
feckin‰Ûª•ÈÀ
"Feckin' emoji movies? More like, Bore: Ragnarok•ÈÀ"
AppleToaster Maybe. But I get the feeling that they would at least buy back the film rights to Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
I don't imagine they'd ever sell those back•ÈÀ
black spiderman - logic•ÈÀ
Another universe•ÈÀ
0:10 Spiderman 2?•ÈÀ
This might actually be good•ÈÀ
i want to seeee it so BADDD•ÈÀ
"This is gonna be lit AFbtw anyone down to be yt friends? I am an amateur make music videos.•ÈÀ"
Don't know whether to hate it or see it in the future.•ÈÀ
"Yeah yeah yeah but where's my Japanese Spider-Man with Leopardon? I kid, I kid (sorta), it's nice to see Spider-Man Noir hit the big screen for once, and with a pretty dope design too. Hope Nicolas Cage does him justice.•ÈÀ"
_Ù÷_•ÈÀ
Great I just learn the important parts of the movie•ÈÀ
"Did anyone catch scorpion, or at least thats what I think...•ÈÀ"
"A very Mad Max style Scorpion, yeah.•ÈÀ"
This looks like telltale I love it _Ù÷•ÈÀ
"Hey so are these all the spideys in the movie? Or are there going to be more? I don‰Ûªt really mind but would‰Ûªve been cool to see spiderman 2099 or the knight Spider-Man•ÈÀ"
"My main concern is, is Noir Spidey going to stay with his mask on all the time?•ÈÀ"
Lol•ÈÀ
"i love younow say it back-jeff•ÈÀ"
Yay Spider ham•ÈÀ
For everybody too young to know the pig is spider ham and his alter-ego is Peter Porker. You're welcome.•ÈÀ
please tell me that spider-pig is voiced by John Mulaney•ÈÀ
oh my god it is•ÈÀ
He did sound like he had street smarts.•ÈÀ
I can't hear anyone else but Yuri or Tom as Peter now. I hope this is good but it looks really busy instead of focused.•ÈÀ
Looks Awesome love the voice casting.•ÈÀ
Wait did they actually put a anime manga girl in this lol•ÈÀ
Why why must there be a anime Spider-Man why can there just for once not be anime f**** hate anime•ÈÀ

DreamDog NightmareDoge spiderman homecoming AFTER infinity war?•ÈÀ
Arkham Knight Yeah I‰Ûªm confused by what they‰Ûªre asking•ÈÀ
@Arkham Knight like Peter's friend•ÈÀ
@Josh Lel he is talking about the scene where Peter sneaks in and Ned is building a Lego star wars deathstar and then he sees Peter in the Spiderman suit•ÈÀ
@Soul Theory and destroys the Lego death star. That part triggered me•ÈÀ

"I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but...the choppy frame rate might give my eyes a problem if I see it on the big screen. Maybe it's just my phone. I hope so. Cause this movie looks great.•ÈÀ"
So much nostalgia from the start referencing the Sam Raimi movies•ÈÀ
not really digging the choice for gwen's hair but w/e I'm hyped for this movie•ÈÀ
"What did the librarian say to the students?You just deleted the answer LMAO•ÈÀ"
"Ehhh... This movie looks like a mess to me. The animation quality seems poor, and although having a whole bunch of spider men in one movie sounds cool, I really feel like the whole ‰Û÷spider verse‰Ûª aspect of the movie will really do a number on the story and overall heart of it. It doesn‰Ûªt excite me like a marvel movie trailer usually does. It really just feels too all over the place. I hope the movie does well, but this trailer doesn‰Ûªt make my opinion of it go higher than what I had previously thought of it.•ÈÀ"
"That Random Banana Animation isn‰Ûªt really poor, they just try to get a comic book feel with the animation. It‰Ûªs just a different style than what we‰Ûªre used to.•ÈÀ"
"That‰Ûªs fair I guess. For me, by their making it more comic book-esque, they‰Ûªre making the movie a bit too choppy for my taste.•ÈÀ"
Nice. I actually want to see it•ÈÀ
Yes YES YESSSSSS!!!! This movie is going to be the sh*t!!!. Sony may not do well with live action this animated movie is going to be AWESOME.•ÈÀ
I freaked out when I heard John Mulaney•ÈÀ

"let me guess, u only played or watched the new spiderman game but never read the comics of Miles Morales as spiderman•ÈÀ"
I‰Ûªm shooketh•ÈÀ
"I just realized that in the first moments of Spider man's monologue, all the scenes are from Spider-man 1 & 2 by Sam Raimi. Also, the main villan looks like The Prowler•ÈÀ"

Maybe this will safe the Spider-Man series•ÈÀ

Gwen um no this is just dumb amazing spider man had gwen in it and she was definitely not another spider man. Also did I hear nicholas cage•ÈÀ
Oh boy. Gwen has been shown as another Spider-person in some shows and the comics.•ÈÀ
Lemme gues youve have no idea what the spiderverse is and know from marvel•ÈÀ
"Noah Burkett Spider Gwen is a thing, along with Spider Ham, Spider Knight, and Noir Spider Man. And many, many more spiderpeople.•ÈÀ"

They had to do a BLACK Spider-Man so it didn't look Racist!_Ù÷©•ÈÀ
You clearly don't know who Miles Morales is he's been a character since 2011 and he's actually a way different and interesting (in my opinion) than Parker•ÈÀ
So apparently this is a post credit scene from venom•ÈÀ

Gwen is scorpion from fortnite•ÈÀ
JOHN!!!•ÈÀ
HYPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
I need 50ccs of Spider Ham saying it can get weirder memes•ÈÀ
"This looks awesome as far as design, story, acting, etc.......EXCEPT THE ANIMATION!!!Why does it look like 3 out of every 24 frames are missing? It's hurky jerky as if it's taking a second to get into focus. It's very hard to read.•ÈÀ"
It's kinda like replicating stop motion•ÈÀ
@Kappa Critic  YES! I couldn't put my finger on it but yes! Not even modern stop motion but OG King Kong!•ÈÀ
"Cluracan  As mentioned already, it has a stop-motion effect. You must have the visual senses of a housefly if this looks like OG King Kong to you.•ÈÀ"
Insert Spider-Man pointing to Imposter Spider-Man meme•ÈÀ
What's up with the animation. It kinda makes my eyes hurt. Feels like it skeeps frames on every move.•ÈÀ
Didn‰Ûªt even know who the overly referenced anime girl was and I said I‰Ûªm gonna spend all my fortnite money to see and eventually buy this•ÈÀ
They remade the same story but made him a gay Mexican... wow.. so creative guys.. #MakeSomethingOriginal•ÈÀ
"""Same story"" this is totally different from the spiderverse original comics and anyways Miles was in that too so stfu•ÈÀ"
@Some Robot go waste your money then dummy lol you're just mad because you know I'm right•ÈÀ
@Bland Collard Greens that's literally the worst argument I have ever heard since fucking 2nd grade•ÈÀ
@Some Robot good comeback.. go give marvel your money for a movie that you've seen 1000 times already hahahahaha•ÈÀ
@Some Robot #SaltyBoy•ÈÀ
"@Some Robot ""I'm right, you dummy (wow, veerrrry offensive). I am right, u r wrong. Proof? Uhhh. Ur wrong and u know it. Lolz""Basically the other's argument•ÈÀ"
@Bland Collard Greens any actual reasons why you think it's exactly like the other movies? I see almost no parallels•ÈÀ
@Kappa Critic you're too sensitive•ÈÀ
"@Some Robot yeah ...uh.. in the name.. ""spiderman""•ÈÀ"
"@Bland Collard Greens Ah yes, summarizing an argument. I must honestly be the most sensitive being ever. Honestly just leave actual reasoning behind ""It's just the same movie"" rather than just saying ""I'm right"". Tbh. I'm not mad, I just wanna see where this conversation leads•ÈÀ"
"@Kappa Critic Kappa like a side character just wondering how the hell this ""argument"" gonna turn out•ÈÀ"
@Bland Collard Greens also at this point I can't tell if your joking or not•ÈÀ
"@Some Robot Yes, I only get a few lines this episode, and I'm gonna make the most of 'em.•ÈÀ"
spider pig...simpson's did it!•ÈÀ
So is like miles universe only have two spider-men or just one?•ÈÀ
"In comics he's second Spider-man to appear, although some of Peter clones survived, like Jessica Drew - she became local Spider- Woman. But since then Miles lives in main universe.In this cartoon however, it seems that Miles is first Spider-Man to appear, as it seems Peter never became one.•ÈÀ"
I know this is animated but darn Gwen looks cute.•ÈÀ
"Ghetto man, i bet in this movie he would be eating fried chicken and probably have a gun in his bag.•ÈÀ"

Cicolas Nage!•ÈÀ

This actually looks really good•ÈÀ
Peter Parker isn't spider Man .Why do you this!•ÈÀ
"Pretty sure the WHOLE point of this movie was to show that there are MULTIPLE Spider-People. Peter Parker is Spider-Man in HIS dimension, Miles Morales is Spider-Man in HIS dimension, same as Gwen Stacy, Spider-Ham, etc. Sort of WHY it's called ""Into the Spider-Verse""•ÈÀ"
This sounds like the flash•ÈÀ
They should of put spiderman 2099 too (Miguel O'Hara).•ÈÀ
Homer Simpson:  spider pig   spider pig   does whatever a spider pig does•ÈÀ

For a second I thought this was for Spiderman Far From Home ;-;•ÈÀ
The so-so popsicle joke made me laugh.  I would go to the ice cream truck after school when I was a kid and get that popsicle.  It wasn‰Ûªt good.  Its eyes were stale gumballs. But it was Spiderman.•ÈÀ
I would always go for the Spongebob one or the Ninja Turtle one. I would always be disappointed that the turtle was always Raphael...•ÈÀ
SPONDER MAN BUT HE‰ÛªS BLAAAAACK•ÈÀ

"Ok, so we got Spider-Man, Mile Morales, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. I love it. Hopefully they make a sequel that would introduce Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker), Superior Spider-Man, and Silk.•ÈÀ"
Luis Lopez and PS4 Spider man•ÈÀ
Don't forget spiderwoman•ÈÀ
Jess G Which Spider-Woman? They're several who carry that title•ÈÀ
@NakedSnake1836 I'm assuming he means Jessica Drew•ÈÀ
Scarlet Spider( Ben Rielly) Scarlet Spider 2 Kaine•ÈÀ
"@NakedSnake1836 I'm a big fan of Jessica Drew, for entirely non-first-name related reasons. Also her original costume is pretty iconic•ÈÀ"
Luis Lopez holy Stan•ÈÀ
"what about Ben Reilly, Spiderman Japan, Lady Spider, Spiderman UK, Cosmic Spiderman, Ashley Barton, Kaine.....wow there's way more than I remembered.•ÈÀ"
I think there is more to it then what they showed here so they might have other spidermen or women in the actual movie•ÈÀ
"Luis Lopez All I want is LEOPARDON•ÈÀ"
Really hoping for superior and 2099•ÈÀ
Peni Parker? I think you mean Peter Parker•ÈÀ
Puss in Boots' Overweight Cousin Uh no that‰Ûªs the Japanese schoolgirl version•ÈÀ
@Dr. G&W  oh ok•ÈÀ
"And Mega Robot Spider-Man, From The Comic With Spider-Ham•ÈÀ"
And spiderman from the 60s•ÈÀ
"They might already be in the movie they're just hiding it because in the backgroundyou can see the Spiderman Ps4 costume•ÈÀ"
Well since Spiderman 2099 is in Normal Spiderman's future time travel would have to be involved wouldn't it? That would be way past complicated.•ÈÀ
@Puss in Boots' Overweight Cousin Peni Parker is the name of the anime girl spider-man•ÈÀ
Spiderman 2099 is awsome.•ÈÀ
@CheesyPasta - Salad I get it already•ÈÀ
How about Spider-Carnage?•ÈÀ
"Luis Lopez spider pig, spider pig•ÈÀ"
@Yellow Flame Gaulent I think a standalone Spider-Man Classic and Spider-Man 2099 movie would be awesome it would be like Spider-Man Edge of Time•ÈÀ
@Bobby Nolan Spider-Ham Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
Dr. G&W you mean henti spider-woman or spider-girl•ÈÀ
"Ah, I almost forgot about Spider-punk•ÈÀ"
CheesyPasta - Salad it‰Ûªs a reference to the simpsons movie.•ÈÀ
It's not actually. Spider-ham predates the Simpsons Movie. He was an actual parody comic made by Marvel.•ÈÀ
"Iggy Azalea- Kream ft. TygaHOTTEST MUSIC VIDEO _ÙÕÑ_ÙÕÑ_ÙÕÑ•ÈÀ"
I'm so hype for this movie now than I was before•ÈÀ
Why is the Frame rate so bad?! And there is little to no lip sync•ÈÀ
Probably to make it look more like something out of a comic book.•ÈÀ

"I'm here because it's not God's will that any of you perish but all of you repent to receive eternal life. Many people are not prepared for the return of Jesus Christ. I've seen Him and He looks nothing like the famous pictures. He is coming back soon to judge the world. Repentance is a gift, now is the time to seek Him and turn away from all wrongful acts before it's too late.Many die suddenly and unexpectedly everyday, these are our friends and family. They enter hell for all eternity, because they died without Jesus Christ. I don't wish to see anyone of you in agony for all eternity. I'm in oneness with God's will. He loves and cares for you all.You have the voice to change the eternal destination of your friends and family members, if your willing. God will not force His will on anyone. If you care about them than you know the right decision, come work for the only kingdom that will last forever, if your willing. I wish to see many of you changed into the image of Christ and all for His Glory. I wish to see all you guys reunited in God's kingdom with your friends and family, but that will not happen unless you are willing to do God's will.If your willing seek God with all your heart until you find Him. He will speak to you at His time, once He does obey Him until the end, and even unto death. Your reward will be with Him in the only kingdom that will last forever, heaven.Take care and God bless you•ÈÀ"

"@Bocaj Issor I dont need to watch the movie when the trailer is right here. What part of this trailer would even make you think of watching it? At most,   there is a heroic plot but no story. That to me is garbage, something I wouldn't even take kids to see if I had any. Unless I want them brain washed.•ÈÀ"
Nevermind I‰Ûªm autistic. Just did research to make sure I‰Ûªm not retarded and I am. Turns out that Marvel allowed Sony to make this since they were working on it before they bought the rights of Spider-Man back from Sony.•ÈÀ

YESSS! Spiderman Noir is in the movie•ÈÀ
Spiderman noir is my favorite Spiderman and he is being voiced by our lord and savior Nicolas cage but what makes me mad is he only says two words in the trailer other then that I liked the trailer and im excited to see this movie•ÈÀ
SPIDER FUCKING PIGGGGG•ÈÀ
Madame Web or Aunt May ?•ÈÀ
1:12 he got fatter•ÈÀ
Pause at 1:38 you'll see The Advanced Suit from spiderman Ps4!!!! Behind the lady with white hair•ÈÀ
Nicholas Cage as Spider-Man Noir. Voice is pretty solid for a 1930s Spidey•ÈÀ
PENI OMG PENI!!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
I love how they Incorporated Spider-Man 2 when Tobey Maguire saved the train and stop the car from hitting mj•ÈÀ
Sir Panda and respecting how that film was actually great in so many ways•ÈÀ
What if this is the sequel of the rami trilogy in a way ?•ÈÀ
I thought it was twilight•ÈÀ
@Luke Bannon yes. Is this part of the movies•ÈÀ
@Yung Mauz sequel•ÈÀ
Same with the upside down kissing scene•ÈÀ
I had the same feeling.  That train scene from Spider-Man 2 sums up what Spider-Man is.•ÈÀ
Also the scene were they kiss and Spiderman is upside and the scene when Doc Ock throws a car at Mj and Peter (it's different though cause in the movie he wasn't in the Spider-Man costume when Doc Ock thru the car) so yeah the Spider-Man in this movie is basically the Toby Maguire Spider-Man and is the closest were gonna get to a Spider-Man 4•ÈÀ
"@CheesyPasta - Salad That isn't Tobey's Spiderman. Tobey's Spiderman has organic webs, this Spiderman has webshooters. Also ps4 Spiderman references some of those scenes as well. This is probably from the comics where Peter is 30 years old, and has a company called Parker Industries. He also has a secret base where he keeps his suits on display like Iron Man as you can see in the trailer.•ÈÀ"
Do animals talk in this dimension? Cause i dont want to freak him out. Lmao•ÈÀ
"Something tells me I'm going to love this movie.Peni Parker caught my eye real quick with the whole anime aesthetic she has going on, so that was something•ÈÀ"

"Peter Parker doesn't exist in their world, they'd think he's some cosplayer or something.•ÈÀ"
@Aug but when he says he saved the city's its in his world/universe•ÈÀ

Either way they should have a 4 minute sex scene in this movie•ÈÀ

Nobody cares though.•ÈÀ

The year for Spider-Man to die in infinity war rip•ÈÀ
Well let's hope he doesn't suffer in this movie•ÈÀ
Why does Sony have such a hard time coming up with a live-action Spidey but seems to have hit the nail on the head this easily with an animated flick? I'm so confused by who's running that circus lol.•ÈÀ

"Wait a second... Peter doesn't recognize Gwen?And that's my only complaint with this trailer. Don't screw it up, Sony.•ÈÀ"
Maybe this peter didn't have a Gwen since it's not 616 Peter anyway•ÈÀ
Why is Sony hell bent on turning spiderman into a joke?•ÈÀ
Do not let this trailer distract u from the fact that the same people who made the emoji movie are making this•ÈÀ
The good news is they have learned from their HUMONGOUS mistake•ÈÀ
I can't believe John Mulaney is the spider pig lmaooo•ÈÀ

Logic would love thus•ÈÀ
ayeeee bring back old peter parker•ÈÀ
"I like this movie already, just not the animation style. It looks like fortnite and the frame rate is all weird(at least to me)•ÈÀ"
It's apart of the style it goes from choppy like comic book style to fluent like normal animation•ÈÀ
Christmas huh.... Watch this or the bumble bee movie for the G1 looks I‰Ûªm gonna choose the bumble bee movie for Christmas•ÈÀ

It's a part of the animation style it goes from choppy like comic book  scenes to normal like a fluent animation•ÈÀ
Some Robot Rip•ÈÀ
@zJ Grain ?•ÈÀ
Really love the new Gwen Stacy design•ÈÀ
"Since  the contract with  Marvel Comics requires  Peter Parker,  they  had to play the alternate worlds  angle to be able to use Miles Morales.•ÈÀ"
Gabriel Rodriguez Miles Uncle is already in the Spider-Man movies•ÈÀ
But  this is the first time Miles is in the Spidey suit  in a full length film .   (Not sure if Miles  has  appeared on any of the tv shows)•ÈÀ

WHY DOES SPIDER HAM SOUND LIKE PMSEYMOUR I LOVE IT•ÈÀ
Imagine if they had Zombie Spiderman as an antagonist•ÈÀ
"probably not, that comic was dark from what I heard•ÈÀ"
@P0kegymTheHero it was pretty dark I was a really huge fan of the series. I had always wanted to see the story adapted in some form. Live action is a maybe if they were to get the right cast and budget but highly unlikely. I always thought it would work good as an animation.•ÈÀ
Where's 2099 Spider-Man at?•ÈÀ
"Will we get the Emmisary of Hell himself, Supaidaman?•ÈÀ"
I want to like this but the controversy of what the director said still erks me! .-.•ÈÀ
DANCERcow what did he say•ÈÀ
"HoodlumScraggy 1 i don't remember ._.I just know it was something bad.•ÈÀ"
DANCERcow what‰Ûªs the directors name•ÈÀ
HoodlumScraggy 1 Peter Ramsey... i remember now.. he supports ANTIFA! If you know what ANTIFA is look it up. It's an extremist group in America.•ÈÀ
I searched his name on YouTube and there‰Ûªs some vids talking about what he said on Twitter•ÈÀ
HoodlumScraggy 1 yeah.•ÈÀ
I dead have the book miles morales•ÈÀ
A black spiderman?•ÈÀ
NOIR AND HAM!!! YESS!!!•ÈÀ

Kingpins head lol•ÈÀ
Why is the animation so choppy?•ÈÀ
https://youtu.be/5U_RPBjm1rA•ÈÀ
Where is Japanese Spider-Man with a giant robot? Could have used him rather than that anime girl.•ÈÀ
"What is this crap!! There is only one Spiderman, Peter Parker!!!•ÈÀ"
"Andy Goss miles morales debuted years ago.And people love him tbh•ÈÀ"
Where's emo spiderman? he's the MOST important one of the bunch•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham is the best•ÈÀ
Nice product placements.•ÈÀ
2:23 John Mulaney•ÈÀ
Spider-man's BLACK.  How edgy.•ÈÀ
Epic!!•ÈÀ
A black spider man? .. hmm guess you have to try everything when sales are down.•ÈÀ

Who wants JJ Jameson to be in this movie?•ÈÀ
"James Melia Only if it's the Raimi-verse Jameson, voiced by JK Simmons•ÈÀ"
Oh yeah.•ÈÀ
spider-ham is the best version change my mind•ÈÀ
He is in Wakanda at the end. No need for research it‰Ûªs pretty obvious•ÈÀ
the protagonist is black and the animation sucks. No thanks!•ÈÀ
That spiderman 2 reference tho i love it•ÈÀ
"You're here for Peni comments, aren't you?•ÈÀ"
I swear I didn't look up little girls lol•ÈÀ
FBI miles morales was in spider man ps4•ÈÀ
Im loving the artstyle•ÈÀ
YES I AM SOOOOO EXCITED•ÈÀ
Firstly what's with this spider cave we got going on and secondly 1:38  look over Aunt May's shoulder is that what i think it is or am I just playing the game too much because I'm pretty sure that the suit from the game.•ÈÀ
"Tyler Saez you‰Ûªre totaaaaally right, that indeed is the advanced suit because of the bright red and blue color scheme and the huge white spider in the middle, good eye•ÈÀ"
Maybe they could have a cameo of the Spider-Man from Insomniac‰Ûªs Spider-Man coming over from his universe. Either that or it‰Ûªs just an easter egg•ÈÀ
"No, it‰Ûªs spiderman 2099 suit•ÈÀ"
"@Black Panther No, spidermans 2099 white suit is black, white and red, no blue whatsoever. Also, the spider logo isn't white on the 2099 white suit, it's red.•ÈÀ"
Holy shot your right•ÈÀ
NO WAY•ÈÀ
"@DroptopGazer nnn vvvcczasaXk k ser Sunny GC E1 GG! ÌÕszcxccc Ì±gcgg.•ÈÀ"
Tyler Saez can y‰Ûªall sub to me please?•ÈÀ
"All Spider-Mans (men?) throughout media exist. They all have their own dimension, but they all exist. So them leaving in easter eggs of the ps4 game isn't so much fan service, as it is acknowledging that spidy-fact.•ÈÀ"
There's a comic book based around this movie and the andvanced suit Spidey is part of the universe so it's a possibility•ÈÀ
Yep•ÈÀ
Ooo•ÈÀ
Tyler Saez nice catch!•ÈÀ
I see 1:38•ÈÀ
I really do hope this movie references the spider man game and also reference how bad the Amazing Spiderman franchise was lol.•ÈÀ
He got that from Emergency Awesome's breakdown.•ÈÀ
What the heck•ÈÀ
Can't wait for this movie!!!‰÷ •ÈÀ
bruh wym he emoji movie was fucking fire my guy•ÈÀ
You are right•ÈÀ
OMG yes it is! wow!•ÈÀ
"In The Amazing comics Peter is  30 years old, and has a company called Parker Industries where he's basically rich, but he still secretly goes around as Spiderman. He actually has a secret base where he keeps his Spider suits on display kinda like Iron Man.•ÈÀ"
Gwen‰Ûªs design looks baddddd•ÈÀ
Is that the score or a song?•ÈÀ
Sp//dr!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
Anyone else notice the police cars say ‰ÛÏ PDNY ‰ÛÏ•ÈÀ
"This movie is going to be amazing, ultimate and spectacular•ÈÀ"
Ironically also the difficulty choices in Spider-Man PS4•ÈÀ
Allan Perez please learn what ironic means. Thank you•ÈÀ
"@Someone whose opinion should not matter to you he used it right, Ironically the comment said the difficulty levels in PS4 Spiderman.•ÈÀ"
OpticalSpace Reborn actually no the difficulties are friendly amazing and spectacular•ÈÀ
@Lucas Lam One word difference ;_; You should know what he/she meant by context clues.•ÈÀ
Could you also say... Superior?•ÈÀ
"No. Amazing, ultimate, and spectacular are popular Spider-man comic book series. The game's difficulties are based off of those Spider-man series and/or cliche Spider-man adjectives. It's more likely that's he was referencing the comics, not the difficulties in the game.•ÈÀ"
"@Lucas Lam Wait are we talking about Victor or Allan? If Victor, then this argument has no meaning. If Allan it's most likely he was trying to reference the PS4 game's difficulty, but used  Ultimate instead of friendly.•ÈÀ"
@Lucas Lam dosent really matter if it's about comics or the game modes difficulty•ÈÀ
You gotta i love ya bak_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ

Me too!•ÈÀ
To bad they're not really•ÈÀ
Shouldn't Peter be just a LITTLE weirded out that his dead former-girlfriend is (sort of) suddenly in front of him?   Unless they use a Peter from a continuity where Gwen wasn't a thing......•ÈÀ
This looks fucking lit•ÈÀ
What‰Ûªs it rated•ÈÀ
Miles' Black and Red suit is better than his Red and Blue one•ÈÀ
Yeees spiderman noir is my favorite•ÈÀ

Excess Monopoly or miles is wakandan•ÈÀ
"Although it kinda looks like the wakandan panther God statue, Black Panther is owned by Disney's Studios Marvel so a black panther animated movie will never happen under Sony's name.•ÈÀ"
@Rip Cord What if they partner with sony.•ÈÀ
"@Reginaldus Moes moon There's a good chance that won't be the case ever, as Disney isn't going to give Sony the rights to make a movie about one of their characters whilst they already exist in a live action universe (the MCU). Basically I mean Marvel isn't going to want another Black Panther to exist as an animated character, because they are focusing on him in his live action performance in the MCU. It's not impossible, but incredibly unlikely. I also dont think the statue was a Black Panther reference. There are many buildings in New York with that same exact ornament decorating their corner tops.•ÈÀ"
nic cage and john mulaney? Dope•ÈÀ
At 1:31 the background looks like the cover of Spider-Gwen #1•ÈÀ
That looks so stupid!•ÈÀ

Why isn‰Ûªt Tom Holland voice acting The red spiderman dude >:0•ÈÀ
Because this Spidey is in his late 30's and is married to MJ so Tom wouldn't work as this version•ÈÀ
1:39 Spider-Man PS4 suit behind might be aunt May?•ÈÀ
The movie is gonna be amazing but for ppl who want Tobey who is old af now to voice spiderman then y'all weird just go watch the movie and enjoy it•ÈÀ
I still feel it's a missed opportunity to get Tobey to voice Peter. Maybe they could even get a cameo with Andrew's Spidey in. That would be neat.•ÈÀ

Plz tell me Spider-Ham says ‰ÛÏThis is the height of luxury‰Û or ‰ÛÏStreet Smarts‰Û in this film•ÈÀ
"I‰Ûªm confused, what the hell is this•ÈÀ"
"Well, it's actually Spider-Mens (Yes, plural, since they are many).In the lot, there are two that I have trouble understanding their possible importance in the film and especially their craze: The Spider Mecha (for the Japanese public and the fans of Mecha?) And Spider-Ham (for the kids or comic humor fans absurd and cartoonesque?).I'm going to see him, that's for sure, but I'm afraid that all these characters will encroach on Miles Morales' scriptural importance. Not totally convinced also for Spider-Gwen (I already said what I thought: ""We lose the dramatic side that had endured Peter, all his, blah blah ..."").Well, since it's centered on the Spider-Verse (with its 30/40 Spider-Man derivatives), we can understand this abundance of Spider-Mens for a single movie. To see, out of curiosity, and to know a little more (and maybe end up giving them some consideration) these multiple characters and their universes ^^•ÈÀ"
"I'm beginning to think that Peter in this film is from the Raimi universe, even if Tobey isn't reprising his role.•ÈÀ"

"This is a crazy theory, but since we are seeing an older Peter Parker, I wanna hope that this isn‰Ûªt a older 616 spider man, but the Renew Your Vows Spider-Man, where Peter marries MJ and has a kid, Annie May Parker. Unlikely but I would love for that to happen, because this is about the Spiderverse, and I think it would be kinda a bummer if Peter Parker was from Earth-616 and not an alternative Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
Well the upside down kiss and all that stuff never happened to 616 also he would recognise Gwen so yeah no worries•ÈÀ
"Aj Jones It seems like people are saying it is Tobey Macguire Spider-Man, but I just feel like that doesn‰Ûªt make sense because wouldn‰Ûªt they get Tobey Macguire to play Peter if that is the case?•ÈÀ"

Enrique Enriquez III That is Peni Parker look it up•ÈÀ
"Her comic suit was Based in the Evangelion series. It's changed here, but they kept the concept. You can see a Totoro stamp in the left arm of the robot.•ÈÀ"
too bad the super sentai one did not make it•ÈÀ
She's also Japanese•ÈÀ
"At least it had a greater chance of being in the film than Forte Stollen's Tatsunoko Spider Woman getup. Well, maybe we can sit in the Spider Zone and sing to keep our minds off our losses.•ÈÀ"
Less question marks.•ÈÀ
That's Peni Parker operating her Sp//dr suit.•ÈÀ
"Also in Edge of the Spiderverse #5, Peni Parkers first appearence when she stands up in her class room you can see 2 girls and a boy, the orange haired being a reference to Asuka, blue Rei and brown haired being Shinji, all references to the main characters in Evangelion. Her story is pretty much an homage to Evangelion•ÈÀ"
It‰Ûªs like in a comic based on a dimension where everyone use spider powered robots and she has one•ÈÀ
"00:12 In a restaurant with Mary Jane... in his spidey suit? Hmmm•ÈÀ"
"This trailer just feels so ""Spectacular"" to watch. It kinda ""Astonishing"" how much content this trailer is giving to us. It almost gives a ""Superior"" feeling compared to the last trailer. The trailer itself is just so ""Super"" to watch that I just want to watch it over and over. I can't wait for the Movie to come out in Christmas cause I can already tell that this going to be ""Amazing"" for our Friendly-Neighbourhood Spiderman.•ÈÀ"

"Tbh, I‰Ûªm willing to believe that this is gonna be the better Spider-Man movie than Venom, and it better be! It‰Ûªs actually seems to be incorporating some more unique Spider-Man styles here now! I feel like this is Sony‰Ûªs way of saying ‰ÛÏHey, listen bro, we made the Emoji Movie last year, we‰Ûªre sorry, here, have Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse‰Û! Sony, I forgive you!

I just posted a fire intro•ÈÀ
2:28 reminds me of Wakanda•ÈÀ
"If only this movie wasn't a SJW fest, this is so disappointing.•ÈÀ"
Eric Larson what do you mean•ÈÀ
"What I mean is that the main Spider-Man, Peter Parker, is sidelined, for a black Spider-Man. I'm fine with a black Spider-Man, but when the main Spider-Man is a side character it makes me mad, and it seems like they are going for a, ""empowering,"" message that might be the good kind of empowering message.•ÈÀ"
Eric Larson that ‰ÛÏblack spider man‰Û is called miles morales•ÈÀ
"Yea, I know what his name is. What is your point?•ÈÀ"
And people want something with miles morales as the main character•ÈÀ
"Not saying that he can't be in a movie, but it's very, ""SJW,"" of Disney to make a movie where a black Spider-Man and a female Spider-man as the main characters, when the normal Spider-Man is just a side character. Even Stan Lee disagreed with what they did to Spider-Man. To quote him, ""I wouldn‰Ûªt mind, if Peter Parker had originally been black, a Latino, an Indian or anything else, that he stay that way. But we originally made him white. I don‰Ûªt see any reason to change that. ... It has nothing to do with being anti-gay, or anti-black, or anti-Latino, or anything like that. Latino characters should stay Latino. The Black Panther should certainly not be Swiss. I just see no reason to change that which has already been established when it‰Ûªs so easy to add new characters. I say create new characters the way you want to. Hell, I‰Ûªll do it myself.""•ÈÀ"
Eric Larson i don‰Ûªt get it can you just say something short and to the point what‰Ûªs wrong with this movie•ÈÀ
"I don't get why you care whether or not it's short or long, you wanted reasons, I gave you reasons.•ÈÀ"

"Well, this is Sony, not Marvel, soooooo...•ÈÀ"
@Mr. Money it's still a marvel movie•ÈÀ
Mr. Money Stan Lee has appeared in previous Spider-Man movies made by Sony sooooo...•ÈÀ
"@Matthew Smith nope, is a Sony movie, Marvel is only the producer•ÈÀ"
"@Uniaza aka Loki Fangirl after that so goes an idk, I thought was kinda obvious•ÈÀ"
"@Mr. Money You said it yourself, it's marvel so most likely Stan lee will be in it. Hell, he was in the end credits scene for Big Hero 6, and there was no marvel branding in that movie at all•ÈÀ"
"@Matthew Smith It is not a Marvel movie, it's a Sony movie, but Marvel has given Sony the right to use some characters, like Spiderman, also, the main reason why Miles Morales is the main character is because his rights were bought by Sony in the 90s. Marvel isn't directing or financing the movie, they only appear as producers because they've let them use some characters.Anyway Stan's gonna appear for 5 seconds doing something, obviously•ÈÀ"

HoodlumScraggy 1 But why?•ÈÀ
Andre Marchand it‰Ûªs animation style is based on comic books•ÈÀ
"HoodlumScraggy 1 As in, the panels of comic books? But most of the time they act as completely different shots and angles. How do they translate into frames of animation? I don‰Ûªt see the correlation. Wait...so does that mean fighting game art styles are based on comic books/manga?...I don‰Ûªt understand!•ÈÀ"

"@WHO DAT Bob maybe, or maybe the Peter in this movie died and that's his grave stone, they just fooled us into thinking it's Miles' Peter•ÈÀ"
"@Edwin diaz Miles' universe plays out exactly like it did in the Ultimate comics, Peter dies and Miles becomes Spiderman after. What your saying is too convoluted and no way they'd show that in the trailers.•ÈÀ"

you know there is going to be a explosion of gwen stacy porn•ÈÀ
There already was when she got her own comics•ÈÀ
That already happened back in 2014.•ÈÀ
No Peni Parker will explode•ÈÀ
Peni Parker is the anime verison so she most likely would get more Hentai rather than normal porn.•ÈÀ

We all need a little Peter Porker in our lives•ÈÀ
@Prism Skull thats his real name in that universe•ÈÀ
@Abstract Monkey I know I've just always found it funny•ÈÀ
how is no one talking about the fact Peni Parker is like literally the anime girl and will probably be made into the most memes (next to peter porker over here)•ÈÀ
@Jewel Mine  she is the evangelion spidermanåÊI remember when she blew up last time•ÈÀ
Soul Fox32 peter porker XD•ÈÀ
her mecha from what I remember is Evangeilon reference in the comics anyway.•ÈÀ
Just Spider Ham being in the movie means I won't be seeing this garbage.•ÈÀ
@noisyturtle why?•ÈÀ
"Between Spider Gwen, Spider Ham, and whatever that anime girl cancer is - this film is appealing to the exact kinda person I fucking hate.•ÈÀ"
That Black Panther shot at the end know what I mean?•ÈÀ
why is the animation so 'choppy'?? it's so distracting•ÈÀ
"Suppose to be like a comic, kinda like comic frames. Suppose to be noticable its part of the artstyle. A example, slowdown the footage and focus on the little deatails like the shading and lighing and artstyle.•ÈÀ"
Nice! Noir Spider!•ÈÀ
Voiced by Nicholas Cage•ÈÀ
I love the trailer cant wait to see the movie.•ÈÀ
"This looks cool.  I am, however, throwing a major flag for Peter not knowing who Gwen Stacy is.  And minus a few points for the silly scurrying around in the corner as a group thing.Other than that, I'm excited to see it.•ÈÀ"
Robert Wilson Um the scurrying away was hilarious. Also he only knows his version of Gwen. He knows nothing of Spider Gwen.•ÈÀ
"@Benjamin Ruggles I admit that the scurrying was funny, just odd.  You'll have to excuse me.  I've been  watching too much CinemaSins.Also, only knowing his version of Gwen is different from not knowing Gwen at all.  It's just a trailer, so it's unclear whether she has the mask or or not when he asks the question.Either way, I'm still excited.•ÈÀ"
peter parker is daddy•ÈÀ
"1:35 that's Nicholas Cage by the way. If he doesn't go over the top this time, we riot.•ÈÀ"
But Noir isn't particularly over the top.•ÈÀ
"He's playing The Peter Parker from the Noir Universe, so I doubt he'll be going over the top since that Peter is a darker, more stoic take on the character.•ÈÀ"
MemeMayor He got to be Superman AND Spider-Man in one year? Dang.•ÈÀ
Yeah but he‰Ûªs played by Nicholas Cage•ÈÀ
"Maxwell Shapiro Dont forget Nicholas Cage is Ghost Rider•ÈÀ"

Spiderman isn't black sorry. Make black panther white then.....•ÈÀ
There's more than one universe where he isn't white...•ÈÀ
@Raemonn Ramos no. There just doing it to appease the pc culture that's ruining the world•ÈÀ

Red_Aza I was born in 2005 and Toby Maguire is my favorite Spider man I think Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
Justin nices•ÈÀ
I'm also nutting because NICOLAS CAGE IS SPIDER-MAN NOIR!!!•ÈÀ
"@AestheticNIro No, your dad nutted to create you.•ÈÀ"

"@Red_Aza,that's because the Spiderman here is played by actor Jake Johnson.I didn't realize it at first,but I knew the voice was somehow familiar.Check Google for this movie and you'll see.•ÈÀ"
"@Stephanie Zambrano Someone who isnt Tobey Maguire isn't Tobey Maguire?Woah dude.•ÈÀ"
"@Red_Aza Aw c'mon•ÈÀ"
I really hate this comment. So so much. Or correction not this comment but the people who put Toby's Spider-Man on a pedestal. I'm glad the peter in this isn't Toby. He had garbage movies. Even though I loved his Spider-Man as a kid I now see that they were trash. Comparing this Spider-Man (even if there are Toby references) to Toby hurts me. He's gone and I hope he isn't coming back.•ÈÀ
Yeah sure•ÈÀ
Yes mah dood•ÈÀ
"I've quietly never given up hope for a Spider-Man 4, and this'll do.•ÈÀ"
"Lordy, it touched my Spider-Man loving heart. Super excited for Spider-Man Noir and Spider Ham though.•ÈÀ"

You say that like it's a bad thing.•ÈÀ

Kevin Marques no actually I think they are all pretty garbage in their own way. Not gonna lie I like tom holland the most. Just saying.•ÈÀ
Boom _ÙÕ£_ÙÕ´•ÈÀ
Finally something totally different!_ÙÕø•ÈÀ
Marvel finally making a good animation•ÈÀ
Im only here for spider ham•ÈÀ
hey•ÈÀ
Who else loves that Miles Morales is wearing Jordan 1 Chicago‰Ûªs?•ÈÀ
The way to be a spider man is to not feel so good•ÈÀ
Yooooooo Spider man noir!!! and spider pig!!!! have to see it now...•ÈÀ
The Anime Preacher a Spider Ham.......•ÈÀ
Oh my god it can‰Ûªt come out soon enough•ÈÀ
They could have gotten Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire to voice Peter Parker _Ù÷Á•ÈÀ
Just A Random Guy there voice doesn‰Ûªt fit how the character looks•ÈÀ
"Officer,I Love You;)•ÈÀ"
"Yes multiple spiders from other dimensions, that‰Ûªs what we need thank you _Ù÷__Ù¥á_Ù¥á_Ù¥á•ÈÀ"
The animation is not bad. Comic book vibes•ÈÀ
"In spider pig's universe, would black panther be a REAL panther?•ÈÀ"
"That's an interesting question, he maybe would•ÈÀ"
"j Jr. actually yeah, this happened in Web Warriors. Also Thor is a dog and cap is a big cat (can‰Ûªt remember the other except I think Iron Mouse!)•ÈÀ"
u just had to be that ... one•ÈÀ
That would be weird. Why would that universe's Spider-Man be a pig but another animal themed super hero be faithful to the animal it's based on?•ÈÀ
Dylan Ogega Spider ham was originally a spider but got transformed into pig by a pig named May Porker ( hence the name Peter Porker).•ÈÀ
what about the vulture ?•ÈÀ
j Jr. no my dad•ÈÀ
Deadpool is a panda in the pigs universe•ÈÀ
Hulk is a rabbit.•ÈÀ
Would Thor be a white grape?•ÈÀ
@Alessio Berni I guess surnames work differently in that universe too.•ÈÀ
TRASH•ÈÀ
"Don‰Ûªt hate me but why Spider-Gwen looks Like Spider-Lesbian???Well it just me but hey I‰Ûªm still gonna watch the movie•ÈÀ"

1:56 you can see Tombstone•ÈÀ
Oh so its truth•ÈÀ
If in the next trailer Spider-man 2099 is on it  I'M BUYING THE MERCHANDISE ASWELL AS THE TICKET•ÈÀ
Nic Cage as Noir is the best thing I have ever seen•ÈÀ
When Sony tries to use up all of the Spider-Man charm before Disney gets their hands on him.•ÈÀ
"Spider Ham is finally in the movieI am now digging this•ÈÀ"
Yet people will only refer to him as spider pig. Sad world we live in•ÈÀ
Veradux1223 lol•ÈÀ
Veradux1223 yes•ÈÀ
Noooo they changed the animation style•ÈÀ
What do you mean? It still has that comic book feeling.•ÈÀ
I AM LOVING SPIDER-MAN NOIR‰ÛªS OUTFIT AAAAAAHHHH•ÈÀ

@The real Phoenix you're factually wrong•ÈÀ
"Technically, the animation looks off on ITSV.•ÈÀ"
@Ray Mejia it's meant to seem like stop motion•ÈÀ
0:19 feel old yet•ÈÀ
"We need a hero, couragous sacrificing people, setting examples for all of us. Everybody loves a hero, people line up for 'em, cheer for them, scream their names, and years later tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who told them to HOLD ON a second longer. I believe theres a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble. And finally gets us to die with pride. Even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want most, even our dreams.•ÈÀ"
nobody survives even one bit What???•ÈÀ
Aunt May is so wise.•ÈÀ
I wat the best game spiderman•ÈÀ
"Looks cool, but I'm worried there are going to be a lot of plot holes. Why didn't Peter recognize her and say ""Gwen, you're alive!""•ÈÀ"
"Wish this was just a miles movie we do not need noir, gwen or the fucking pig. Though I like the main 3 I do think that it would have been better with what the original trailer showed us.•ÈÀ"

Hell even the Spider-Gwen from the comic had normal hair with the classic headband. Maybe they‰Ûªll explain why the change in the film, it‰Ûªs not exactly movie ruining, just an odd design. I can see her and Peters interaction with each other being interesting seeing both of their history with eachother in their own respectable universes in the original Spider-Verse book.•ÈÀ"
"I mean, she is a punk rocker, so  it makes sense•ÈÀ"
@Dr. Blooberson Not every female punk rocker has hairstyle like that.•ÈÀ

Now that is how you put a trailer out. Love it!•ÈÀ
"Looks like a great movie and its great miles and I have the same last name i was just confused at first seeing an afro latino as Spiderman since i was used to the white Peter Parker,  i didn't know this Spiderman was inspired by Barack Obama and Donald Glover and created in 2011 by Brian Micheal Bendis , its great to experiment with different ethnicities and completely change characters imagine an asian batman or mexican Superman  _ÙÔ possibilities are endless I love it cant wait to see this movie it looks awesome•ÈÀ"
ok now DC. are you watching? reading? feel free to copy marvel and their animated movies. because you can do that right. just stop trying to copy them with your live action movies mmkay precious?•ÈÀ
"""You gotta say I love you back!""""Dad, are you serious?""That gave me the best laugh.•ÈÀ"
"1:43 ""Is that a... Cartoon pig?""•ÈÀ"
Who in the world is that anime girl though•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker, Half Asian school girl, pilot of the SP//dr, a robot, and one of the many heroes in the 2014 Comics Spider-Verse storyline.•ÈÀ"
1:36 s s spider noure•ÈÀ
"Prob gonna be one of the best theatrical super hero movies ever, I hope more animated superhero films come to theatres, I'm not counting Teen Titans Go..•ÈÀ"
"Woody Even then, TTG‰Ûªs movie wasn‰Ûªt even bad. I mean, it was TTG, but it was entertaining enough.•ÈÀ"
@Xavier Paris Plus it had Will Arnett•ÈÀ
"Plz let tom holland be in this movieEdit: welp guess not `^å«•ÈÀ"
Lizbeth Pedilla he‰Ûªs not•ÈÀ
Lizabeth PedillaåÊ Won't happen since Sony is making a Homecoming sequel.•ÈÀ
@Jeremy Riley welp•ÈÀ
@Arachnid Comics its fine at least ge might be i avengers 4•ÈÀ
Wow they spoiled alot of the film...•ÈÀ
Looks like a cool movie but why Spiderman black this time•ÈÀ
"You do realize Miles Morales is a Spider-Man from a different universe, and that Peter is also in this film, do you?•ÈÀ"
Because jews run the movie industry and can't stand him to be white anymore. Inform yourself and grow up•ÈÀ
My hype for this movie is through the roof!•ÈÀ
OMG I CANT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE I WANT TO SEE IT NOW•ÈÀ
Already sucks•ÈÀ
LOLIS•ÈÀ
Please don‰Ûªt be PG•ÈÀ
why not ?•ÈÀ
Its not its rated G (;•ÈÀ
TheDiamondCraft TDC you wanted a rated r?•ÈÀ
What would a film like this gain from not being PG??•ÈÀ
You want it to be R•ÈÀ
He means that he wants it PG-13•ÈÀ
TheDiamondCraft TDC   It‰Ûªs X rated•ÈÀ
ur right we need gwen•ÈÀ
Of course it‰Ûªs gonna be PG ....•ÈÀ
I don't want this movie to be a pg-13•ÈÀ
"Please don't let this kids movie be rated PG!... Wait, what?•ÈÀ"
Nigga as the spider man OMFG•ÈÀ
It's Miles Morales. He has been around for a very long time now.•ÈÀ
"2:29I see that Black Panther reference•ÈÀ"
"1:06 yup, spiderman's universe was bit in half, maybe an infinity war reference?•ÈÀ"
I like Spiderman but is it just me or have they made too many versions of Spiderman?•ÈÀ
"TBH, Sony is doing thisåÊmovie as non-canon to the MCU, and this and Venom need to succeed if Spidey is going to stay in the MCU.•ÈÀ"
"With all the Sam Rami Trilogy references, this seems like this movie takes place many years after the events of Spider Man 3•ÈÀ"
"RonJon ohh if they continue the story that is a dream come true,•ÈÀ"
Jesus Christ this isn‰Ûªt the Raimi films continuation. You Raimi fanboys are too hopeful.•ÈÀ
"Except raimi's spiderman didn't have web shooters, it's just a reference don't look to deep into it•ÈÀ"
They reference every spiderman so yeah•ÈÀ
RonJon Spoilers : there just references there not in the same universe•ÈÀ
John mulaney is Spiderham•ÈÀ
This movie looks great. The story looks well written (so far) and I really like the animation style they decided to go for.  The references they make in the trailer are pretty funny.•ÈÀ
All that‰Ûªs missing was the transgender Spider-Man•ÈÀ
I can't tell if this looks really good or really bad•ÈÀ
This looks like it will do amazing in the box office!•ÈÀ
Where's my spiderman 2099?!•ÈÀ
Paulo Criales probably might be saved for a sequel if this film sky rockets.•ÈÀ
So this is basically that episode of ultimate spider from miles' perspective?•ÈÀ
The ending to the trailer  is awesome lol•ÈÀ
One complaint. Toby McGuire‰Ûªs not voicing Peter Parker.•ÈÀ
Tristan McCannåÊ Probably because either Sony couldn't reach him or he is too busy to reprise his role.•ÈÀ
Yuri Lowenthal would have been a better choice anyway.•ÈÀ
"Nah, I like this voice actor and Yuri better than tobey•ÈÀ"
Just because it's referencing the old spider movies doesn't mean Toby McGuire should voice actor...let it go•ÈÀ
"Josh da Quick! exactly, the Tom Holland fangirls and Tobey's fanboys are so annoying•ÈÀ"
"I think Jake Johnson kind of sounds like Tobey Maguire in this movie, like an impression.•ÈÀ"
@Jeremy Riley Sony isn't hiring him anymore.•ÈÀ
He ain't going for it anymore.•ÈÀ
Toby isn't a very good voice actor•ÈÀ
Cuz he‰Ûªs a bad spidey•ÈÀ
"Tobey's a terrible voice actor, look at the movie tie-in games•ÈÀ"
He was either too stubborn or they didn‰Ûªt even bother with asking him•ÈÀ
But I would‰Ûªve liked to see it too though this peter Parker has a bit more ego than the one Toby portrayed•ÈÀ
"Ok, But Why Tho I just think it would be fitting to have the older version of Spider-Man passing on the torch to the younger generation. I just think it would‰Ûªve been fitting.•ÈÀ"
Didn‰Ûªt that Stacy girl die???•ÈÀ
OddsupremekamåÊ This Gwen Stacy is from a different universe like the other Spider-Men.•ÈÀ
"Miles tagging that gargoyle statue at 2:27Pure Genius for a kid like Miles! It's what every artist would do if they had that kind of power.•ÈÀ"
So pumping•ÈÀ
I already Already like this movie•ÈÀ
"This movie looks really good, but I'm still hoping they at least vaguely reference there being other heroes than just Spider-Man in their worlds, because it really annoys me when a comic book movie comes out and that hero is the only superhero in their world; it feels like we should be past that by now.•ÈÀ"
"This, THIS is what DC should be putting on the silver screens..... A N I M A T I O N S They can start with by remastering all of their previous works and doing double feature on all of them!•ÈÀ"
Who is the anime person•ÈÀ
Peni Parker•ÈÀ
Hey•ÈÀ
Lol Fisk looks so weird•ÈÀ
"Sorry, but this is really bad•ÈÀ"
"Definitely my favorite trailer. The more I watch the trailers the more I love the animation! Miles, Spider-Man, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker/SP//dr, and my main pig Spider-Ham! Definitely looking forward to this movie! Also, I'm loving Spider-Gwen's hair style.•ÈÀ"
"Wait wut?Is that an anime girl?•ÈÀ"
Her name is Peni Parker.•ÈÀ
"Man, Yuri Lowenthal is Spiderman to me now. This isn't right lol.•ÈÀ"
Zear you‰Ûªll get used to it•ÈÀ
This isn't Yuri though. It's Jake Johnson.•ÈÀ
0:11 is that tobey maguire‰Ûªs spidery????•ÈÀ
"Seriously, I can not stop watching this trailer, it's amazing!!!•ÈÀ"
Spider-Man And The Search For The Missing Animation Frames•ÈÀ
"Zach Reddy It's supposed to be like this, as it makes it a living comic book.•ÈÀ"
"I understand that it's intentional, but running at the frame rate of a broken N64 game doesn't make it look like a comic book. It makes it look like their render farm has a virus.•ÈÀ"
"Spider manSpider manWhatever a Spider canHe fights Crime with no bloodMr.Stark i dont feel so good•ÈÀ"
The city skyline in this movie looks so good!•ÈÀ
15 fps•ÈÀ
Ummm ok this looks amazing...!!!•ÈÀ

She looks like a lesbian•ÈÀ
"@Dank Scrote what are you, gay?•ÈÀ"
"@Jeffrid A. I agree with you. After all, I expect more hair on the back of her head.•ÈÀ"
"I don't usually find cartoon characters attractive, but they did skmething right here.•ÈÀ"
because she was meant to be and she will always be peter's first lover.•ÈÀ
"Ps4 spider suit, ayy 1:38!!•ÈÀ"
The christmas album and the so so popsicle part had me in tears•ÈÀ
Spider-Gwen lookin hot af•ÈÀ

Closed captions please. Also you should do that closed caption thing. Closed captions are provided by... I want to feel old again•ÈÀ
"Its like they're breaking the 4th wall•ÈÀ"
Is this movie dropping frames?•ÈÀ
It's supposed to feel like a comic book•ÈÀ
"Lol Lololol It‰Ûªs the animation style•ÈÀ"
Idk•ÈÀ
Imagine watching this on a VR headset•ÈÀ
J Johan Jameson is gonna have a heart attack when he finds out.•ÈÀ
Never liked Spiderman _Ù÷Õ_Ù÷Õ•ÈÀ
Then why are you in the comment section of a trailer for a Spider-Man movie?•ÈÀ
Sony steping up there game :3•ÈÀ

"orangeapples yes and that‰Ûªs Penni ParkerHis daughter from the marvel manga-verse.•ÈÀ"
"We got everyone here. MJ might get a little more screen time in this. I‰Ûªm very excited! And what‰Ûªs with the little girl? Who‰Ûªs the villain? Annnnd...WHERE‰ÛªS SPIDER-MAN 2099?!?!?!?!HE‰ÛªS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS MOVIE BECAUSE THIS IS SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE!!!!! WE NEED HIM IN THIS MOVIE!!!!!I believe it‰Ûªs because of the marketing.•ÈÀ"
"There are like 20,000 spidepeople, cut them some slack for not showing all of them.•ÈÀ"
IT LOOKS SO FUCKING GOOD! _ÙÕÏ•ÈÀ
This _Ù_´ movie is going to be lit _ÙÓ´•ÈÀ
"K noir, spider ham, now your gettin‰Ûª it, now we just need 2099•ÈÀ"
The Pig ruins it in my opinion•ÈÀ
KMC20 Spider Ham is amazing.•ÈÀ
Can we have this is in ~25fps?•ÈÀ
Good graphics•ÈÀ
1:37 SOMEONE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME•ÈÀ
"Marshadow Maniac that‰Ûªs Penni ParkerPeters daughter from the Marvel Manga-Verse.•ÈÀ"
@Arachnid Comics thank you so much•ÈÀ
@DylanTendo no prob :)•ÈÀ
"Just got off the phone with chief, he said this most definitely is IT•ÈÀ"
Animation is cool but why is the framerate like 15 fps?•ÈÀ
MULANNY IS SPIDER PIGGGGGG!!!!•ÈÀ
Them Air Jordan 1s_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´•ÈÀ
In this movie I just hope they tie up the Loose Ends from the 90's cartoons _Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷_•ÈÀ
"Trailer looks great, but whoever they cast as Peter Parker is terrible.  That‰Ûªs definitely not his voice.•ÈÀ"
"terrabite87 Eh, works fine for me since he seems to be way older here.•ÈÀ"
I'm sold•ÈÀ
"Gonna be the best Spider-Man movieI hope•ÈÀ"
Cynda Stuff Nope but it‰Ûªll be great.•ÈÀ
They should totally put 2099 spider man in this movie•ÈÀ
This actually might be good but I'll wait until it's on DVD like everyone else lol•ÈÀ
The most unrealistic part is the black kid knowing his father•ÈÀ
Ryan Bigguy Whites can't judge. Especially when half of their white fathers are child rapists Lol•ÈÀ
Story seems a little cliche but HYPE•ÈÀ
_ÙÉ±•ü E T E R _ÙÉ±•ü A R K E R•ÈÀ
This would be an amazing game•ÈÀ
So no one is gonna talk about how they included references to the Sams spider man•ÈÀ
I don‰Ûªt understand the story. Are there multiple spider men?•ÈÀ
Parker Costas Yes•ÈÀ
Parker Costas and women•ÈÀ
You kinda need to read the comics to understand•ÈÀ
There are multiple versions of Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
There are multiple.•ÈÀ
"So basically this movie elaborates on the many alternate universes marvel has exept of seeing all the avengers we get all the spider people, not many comic book franchises make movies on the alternate universes so its hard to understand DC also has alternate universes wich a whole other can of worms.....   It,s pretty interesting you should see what else the internet has to show•ÈÀ"
there certainly are•ÈÀ
Llama lover really tho?•ÈÀ
Alright help me out here is this a crossover or is this going to connect with like homecoming or is this like force awakens and then they do rogue one to get people hyped for last jedi? because if theres like multi universes   in reglar spiderman series this is going to get weird•ÈÀ
This Has nothing to do with the MCU and is only a mashup of a Lot of Spiderman comics•ÈÀ
omg john mulaney•ÈÀ
If there is going to be a sequel then they should introduce venom•ÈÀ
The animation is laggy I'm not watching this Garbage.stop motion and 3d should never mix.•ÈÀ
At first I thought the girl (Gwen Stacy) was going to be Petra Parker•ÈÀ
The Drifter No. Actually read the comics.•ÈÀ
Hahaha this gold•ÈÀ
Spider pig is Homer Simpson‰Ûªs idea•ÈÀ
thargyi85 the Simpsons are always predicting these shits•ÈÀ
thargyi85 spider ham first appeared in ‰Û÷83 though•ÈÀ

This actually looks awesome. Can't wait•ÈÀ
"When in doubt, multiverse it out.•ÈÀ"
Anybody wanna play duos?•ÈÀ
I can't believe John Mulaney is spider-ham lmaooo•ÈÀ
Would of been cool if Charlet Chung did the voice for Peni Parker•ÈÀ
"A Black Spider man, no words to say, other than AWESOME!!!!!•ÈÀ"
Afro-Puerto Rican•ÈÀ
i've never loved a trailer so much before.•ÈÀ

Lol seem kinda funny sometime I think the stuff they make is corny now but it‰Ûªs kinda funny•ÈÀ
"HYPE HYPE HYPE I LOVE THE ANIMATION IS VERY INTRESTING•ÈÀ"
"The TRUE Spider-Man Is Here.https://youtu.be/4ZteJ474Baw•ÈÀ"
"This = good SonyVenom = bad Sony•ÈÀ"
For once it looks like SONY is gonna make a Spider-Man Movie and not screw it up•ÈÀ
"The animation looks so wierdI don't like itBut the trailer is pretty good•ÈÀ"
"""Do animals talk in this dimension cause I don't wanna freak them out?"" Favorite line hahaha_Ù÷â 2:21•ÈÀ"
Release the movie in Tamil•ÈÀ
"Hey, this actually looks good. a fine addition to replace The Amazing Spider-Man movies•ÈÀ"
Lol•ÈÀ
"The worst movies were the original 3, not open for debate•ÈÀ"
"no, it actually looks bad•ÈÀ"
@Nate what are you smoking•ÈÀ
Nate Don‰Ûªt you fucking say that to Tobey again.•ÈÀ
"I actually like the first TASM. It gets too much hate. Not hating on the original though, they were good too.•ÈÀ"
Nate wtf are you smoking and can i get some?•ÈÀ
Nicholas Cage as Spiderman Noir? Cool.•ÈÀ
If only this was canon to the MCU.•ÈÀ
The face at 1:54•ÈÀ
The Amazing Spider-Ham (Peter Porker) is in the film?!  @1:40  Love that character.    Can't wait to see this!   _Ù÷Û•ÈÀ
"Everyone knows spider-ham, you don't have to spell it out.•ÈÀ"
They told the ENTIRE movie plot in this trailer! _Ù_£•ÈÀ
?•ÈÀ
They told us that other spider people are being sucked in to miles dimension. We have known that since they announced that because its in the fucking title XD whats your  point?•ÈÀ
Avakado Addict yeah so•ÈÀ
Classic sony•ÈÀ
"@Sal They're gonna join up, Miles is gonna learn an important lesson, they're gonna go place to place hopping dimensions, and its probably gonna end in a climax with Miles in his world where he proves to his dad that spidey's pretty cool, yakity yak yak.•ÈÀ"
But you still are hoing to watch it no?•ÈÀ
TheDeceivingTopHat 111 are you still gonna watch it?•ÈÀ
"Lol Hi oh yeah totally, just showing that this trailer did kinda spoil a pretty would seem important part of the movie•ÈÀ"
"nowadays trailers may seem like they show everything, where in fact they only show like 2-5% of the movie, at least in my experience•ÈÀ"
This looks fantastic! _Ù¥ü•ü•ÈÀ
#1•ÈÀ
This movies had a problem rendering thats why its like 10 frames per second•ÈÀ
The alternate universe that peter didn't drop gwen.•ÈÀ
Some random Doggo boi _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
"If you read the spider gwen comics, its gwen who killed peter•ÈÀ"
@Jojo 1961 seriously? i thought he suicided.•ÈÀ
KuroRX // Galaxy there was a comic that in a fight with the lizard I think is when Peter died and she took the mantle of Spider-Gwen•ÈÀ
Actually a universe where she was bit by the spider•ÈÀ
"He became the lizard and after a fight between him and gwen, he turned back to normal and died•ÈÀ"
KuroRX // Galaxy guessing you watch  the tlbr spider gwen from marvel entertainment video.•ÈÀ
"WTF is with the framerate?After rewatching this trailer - I can't go to the cinema for this. The low framerate is honestly giving me a headache - feels like everything is bad claymation.•ÈÀ"
And all this time we thought Donald Glover was gonna be the Miles Morales•ÈÀ
"Silent Refusal Ummmm no. He was Aaron Davis. The Prowler, his uncle.•ÈÀ"
these sony trailers are the most cookie cutter•ÈÀ
Am I the only one who wants to see Spider-Man from the 60s cartoon appear?•ÈÀ
Black Spiderman can you save a brother now•ÈÀ
PENI PARKER!•ÈÀ
am I the only one getting Sam Raimi Trilogy vibes here from the start•ÈÀ
I do!•ÈÀ
Not sure if this is how it is but is it just me or is there like a lag ? The frames seem slow•ÈÀ
What‰Ûªs up with Kingpin‰Ûªs face? _Ù÷â 1:53•ÈÀ
"BEST FACE OF ALL HISTORYDEFIANTLY WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!•ÈÀ"

Spider pig spider pig can Web u up with his bacon :3•ÈÀ
They ruined spider man...•ÈÀ
Alex Ummm no but good try.•ÈÀ
"This looks amazing. I love the animation for this movie. Miles, Peter, Gwen, Peni, Noir, and Ham all look great, the only thing I'm sad about is the fact that Miguel A.K.A Spider-Man 2099 is not in this.•ÈÀ"
"I know I might get hate for saying this, but I want peter to stay dead in the mcu so miles morales can be the new Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
I haven't laughed at a trailer in so long. This feels good•ÈÀ
This literally looks like a non-lego Lego movie.•ÈÀ
I wanna see scarlet spider and Spiderman 2099•ÈÀ
Yoooo so this is technically Tobey Maguire Spidey?•ÈÀ
"hears nick cage as spider man noireI think I have just achieved orgasim•ÈÀ"
Why the hell isnt Tobey Maguire voicing old Peter Parker?•ÈÀ
"I think we can call it a blessing in disguise because as good as Toby is with playing as Spider-Man, he's not a very good voice actor. He voiced Spider-Man in the past and it wasn't that great.•ÈÀ"
Because Tobey Can barely act.•ÈÀ
"Because he‰Ûªs a terrible voice actor. Just look at his performance in the old Spider-Man games, absolutely awful. He‰Ûªs still a good actor when we‰Ûªre talking about live-action, though.•ÈÀ"
"Because this was a line:‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs you who‰Ûªs out Gobby...OUt oF yoUr MiND!‰Û•ÈÀ"
@Lazy Willy I'm sure that's why everyone in the fucking game voice acted terribly. The voice director is a key part of that•ÈÀ
"Connor McClintick And how exactly is that Tobey's fault? It was the writers who came up with that line, not Tobey.•ÈÀ"
King Bradberry I see you everywhere•ÈÀ
"PlurmpleYT in video games yes, he does sound great in the films,•ÈÀ"
Uriah Roots bullshit niggaaaa•ÈÀ
"Well, I mean Jake Johnson sounds like Tobey Maguire voicing Peter Parker in this trailer and the last.•ÈÀ"
Too hot for animation•ÈÀ
Pizza time every single line•ÈÀ
Hollywood is not hiring him anymore. #familycomesfirst•ÈÀ
Because this is a different Peter Parker•ÈÀ
"Xeino because he‰Ûªs not a good Spiderman, he also hates being Spiderman•ÈÀ"
Sony is going to need this to be a success to make up for the impending critical failure of the Venom movie.•ÈÀ
Logic's Black Spider-Man•ÈÀ
Can anyone tell me the songs from this trailer ??•ÈÀ
The Kingpin looks like Boss Baby ate too many chicken nuggets  lol•ÈÀ

Cannot be a black spider man tbh•ÈÀ
This movie looks amazing but the other  Spider-Men I wish were in the movie is Spider-Man 2099 and The Japanese Spider-Man from the old Japanese show because I want to see Leopardon because come on he‰Ûªs awesome•ÈÀ
"Kind of disappointed that Peni Parker's mech doesn't look like an EVA tho. Doesn't matter, this movie is going to rock!•ÈÀ"
Aled Zurc maybe it had different modes and during the big fight in the end it transforms•ÈÀ

This movie looks GODLIKE•ÈÀ
Peter Porker!•ÈÀ
"I think you mean, SPIDER-PIG!!!!•ÈÀ"
"The more and more i see of this movie, the more I'm convinced it'll knock it out of the park. The tone, the comedy, and the animation are just superb. Can't wait for this to come out.•ÈÀ"
Yeah this looks awesome but why is there a weeb spidergirl.•ÈÀ
The style is so sexy•ÈÀ
Nic Cage as Noir? I guess we know who the best Spider-Man is now.•ÈÀ
No it‰Ûªs John Mulaney as Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
JOHN FREAKING MULANEY•ÈÀ
Ya 2099 WHY ISN'T HE IN HERE :(•ÈÀ
@Fishcandy that is most definitely the best•ÈÀ
Tobey Maguire >>>>•ÈÀ
Spider-people! We're going to steal this universes Constitution!•ÈÀ

I really hope that they put Spider-Man 2099 in this.•ÈÀ

"How could I been filled up with so much hype within only 2-5 seconds of this trailer!?!?The hype is too real fam•ÈÀ"
this will be amazing _ÙÔ_ÙÓ´•ÈÀ
"A so-so popsicle, yikes_Ù÷É•ÈÀ"
2:10•ÈÀ
why does this art style lag? Isn't this a big budget AAA movie?•ÈÀ
It's an artistic choice. They wanted the movie to have a stop motion feel in order to really feel like a comic book (to reflect the choppiness of going to a different panel).•ÈÀ
"One like is one _Ù  How many _Ù  can we get _Ù  _Ù •ÈÀ"
Dafuq is up with the lip-syncing tho?•ÈÀ

"So we got Original Peter Parker Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, Noir, Spider-Ham, and SP-DR?  What are the chances of us getting Spider Assassin and 2099?•ÈÀ"

Ok well they go thr different spiderman different art style but wheres 2099 spiderman•ÈÀ
I'm so confused. I thought that Miles lived in the same universe as the Peter Parker seen in the movie. Like thats what it looked like in the first trailer.•ÈÀ
This looks like the best movie I didn't know I needed in my life. Now I know.... I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE!!!_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´•ÈÀ
Why is the animation so choppy?•ÈÀ
It's an artistic choice to give the movie a stop motion feel to really sell the comic book look (as it reflects the choppiness of jumping from panel to panel).•ÈÀ
The music reminded me of the 90s spiderman theme song.•ÈÀ
Looks promising but to those jokes are so bad _Ù÷â tbh not my kind of animation•ÈÀ
"I'm still mad that they didn't release Spider ma'am. WE NEED SPIDER MA AM But I'm so excited the other popular dimension Spider-Men get a cinematic debut.•ÈÀ"
"Animation is choppy.Thought it was my device at first, but nope...some scenes are only 30 fps by the look of it•ÈÀ"
Movies are in 24 fps•ÈÀ
Can we leave spider man alone please. Work on something new for crying out loud. _Ù÷© honeslty I'm upset these days. I want to see something new and what comes out? Spider man.•ÈÀ

"Yeah I'm not a fan either, it was kinda off putting. Her costume looks great though, so hopefully the mask is on most of the time.•ÈÀ"
Really? I actually was just about to comment that I really like it. Different tastes I guess•ÈÀ
@Yaxoi I respect your opinion it's okay I'm just used to seeing gwen with her normal long luscious hair•ÈÀ

Spiderpig!! Wassup•ÈÀ
Wait spidey in Wakanda?•ÈÀ
They legit referenced every Spider-Man movie ever•ÈÀ
How?•ÈÀ
That Peter Parker is the Peter Parker from the Sam Rami films•ÈÀ
"ZipperedSoup 69 guess you never watch the OG spider-man films,•ÈÀ"
He's probably more of a fusion of that and the amazing movies cause right after the sam rami scenes we see him gripped by a massive lizard fist.•ÈÀ
@Jojo 1961 ikr•ÈÀ
"That would be pretty cool if they had done that, made Peter Parker look exactly like Tobey Maguire and had this Spidey be literally his spidey•ÈÀ"
@Aidan Taggart it's really not•ÈÀ
"@Roman Frank that's what the trailer makes it seem like with the train stopping and stuff which was in Spiderman 2, didn't notice the lizard in it so it's probably paying homage to the past two iterations•ÈÀ"
nop•ÈÀ
@Aidan Taggart it's just callbacks. He isn't actually Tobey's sm•ÈÀ
KohryuZX that was like hulk. Soo no amazing spuderman reference•ÈÀ
Fearsome Tiger86 Yup.•ÈÀ
Why is there an anime girl in my Spider-Man movie•ÈÀ
"That's Peni Parker, she's another universe's Spidey that fights crime with a mech instead of having super powers.•ÈÀ"

It's supposed to be comic book inspired•ÈÀ
It's like it's constantly dropping frames and bugging out. BUT THAT'S THE STYLE. /s•ÈÀ
Is that good or bad•ÈÀ
"Yep, looks like all the games Telltale makes in terms of art style.•ÈÀ"
Ikr and at the same time to me it looks like claymation•ÈÀ
This movie looks better with each trailer!•ÈÀ
I'm more hyped for this than Venom or Spiderman: Far from Home...•ÈÀ

Please let this SP\\dr be a playable costume in one of the Spider-Man DLCs!•ÈÀ
Why does it have to be animated???•ÈÀ
Jist so you know they wont show every spiderman in the trailer. They could add the 2099 spiderman. Some of these scenes might not even be in the movie and they cluld have easily removed 2099 or anyone else from the trailer•ÈÀ
This is pure eye candy•ÈÀ

"1:40 You can also see Mr Negative in the background and at 1:55, you can also see Tombstone•ÈÀ"
when 15 fps is actually pretty good•ÈÀ
snapkill 12.0 movie prob rushed•ÈÀ
@biscuit they revealed this movie about late 2016 I believe so how is it rushed?•ÈÀ
I think it's just Parker. He's animated at a lower fps.•ÈÀ
"Hikarizu1 Everyone‰Ûªs animated that way, that‰Ûªs the point of the movie. The movie isn‰Ûªt rushed it‰Ûªs animated in a way to give off the comic book feel•ÈÀ"
FirstName LastName it annoys me idk why•ÈÀ
that's intentional. everything moves in 60fps except the characters they run in 15fps... this is a never used effect which looks focking great it gives a comicbook kinda fibe•ÈÀ
*23 fps•ÈÀ
UniqueNameGuy 15fps•ÈÀ
It gives it a neat Stop Motion aesthetic•ÈÀ
snapkill 12.0 The framrate is a stylistic choice•ÈÀ
You won't like it when you actually see it in the big screen.•ÈÀ
The spider mech from Japan tho! Kawaii is the phrase I would use!•ÈÀ

What song is this?!?•ÈÀ
"I was iffy on Nic Cage as Noir before, but I'm sold.•ÈÀ"
So glad that John Mulaney is here to throw the Spiderverse off its rhythm.•ÈÀ
Connor Healy I understood that reference•ÈÀ
Right this is awesome looking•ÈÀ
"Wait, I'm missing the reference, how does this relate to John Mulaney?•ÈÀ"
@Emma he voices spider ham•ÈÀ
"Emma John Mulaney is the voice of Spider Ham, and he‰Ûªs about to ‰ÛÏthrow the Spiderverse off it‰Ûªs rhythm‰Û just like Detective JJ Bittenbinder told him to do with pedophiles back in middle school.•ÈÀ"
Now that‰Ûªs someone who knows the Mulaney•ÈÀ
STREET SMARTS.•ÈÀ
Oh my gosh that's so great!!! I can't believe I didn't recognize his voice! I love his stuff!! I am so excited for this movie!!!!•ÈÀ
Emma Me too! My hype for this movie increased like ten times the second I found out he was involved!•ÈÀ
Anime kawaii spider girl mecha?•ÈÀ
Peni Parker - Google it :)•ÈÀ
The anime one was my fav•ÈÀ
Sp//der. Peni Parker.•ÈÀ
snopa fran Now image a Nasuverse version of Spiderman.•ÈÀ
Sp//dr looks nothing like the comics.•ÈÀ
So is this continuing the Toby movies?•ÈÀ
"Is that an anime waifu with a Spider-Man mecha? Okey, i‰Ûªm all in.•ÈÀ"
Nicolas Cage as Spiderman Noir  is something I never know I needed until now.•ÈÀ
pretty sure they got a few spiders hidden for the movie. Hope it‰Ûªs the otto‰Ûªs superior Spider-Man and 2099•ÈÀ
"Looks promising, but I have one problem, if your wanting to focus on Miles Morales, why shift the focus on other Spider-People, kind of detracts Miles being the lead character when there's a whole other batch of characters just like him.•ÈÀ"
James Smith completely agreed•ÈÀ
James Smith that why it called spider man into the spider verse. It not only going to focus on just miles morales. But the rest of the spider man such as peter Parker Gwen Stacy and so on and so forth.•ÈÀ
@John Carter But it has been said over and over again that miles is the main character•ÈÀ
"That's fine, but if your going to do that then what's the point in having other Spider-People when you're main focus is Miles Morales, it's confusing because one minute we're focusing on Miles, then oh look there's Gwen no wait there's Peter. It doesn't give time for people to get to know Miles at all.•ÈÀ"
"I think the movie is going have the Spider-People be there to support Miles be the Spider-Man for his universe, and through that he'll have character development to have the audience to get to know him. The Spider-People are there for support and I hope they aren't too distracting for the audience to see the development point for Miles.•ÈÀ"
"I feel that the first act will be Miles focused on his origin and how he WANTS to be Spider-Man. The second act will introduce a version of Peter Parker who is alive (like the comics) and teach Miles how to webswing, etc. From that point forward, the other spider-people will teach him aspects of what make their take on being a hero is like. It'll be ""training"" and helping Miles because the Hero that his universe's New York will need.•ÈÀ"
"How does having a support cast detrimental to a main character? You're speaking as if Miles' only distinguishing character trait is that he's Spider Man, and he's just another Spider Man among Spiderpeople. But if he has a lot more going than that, then supporting characters would only lead to interesting interactions between Miles and the others.•ÈÀ"
Read the spiderverse comic•ÈÀ
They might just be supporting characters. Plus the trailer doesn't really do it justice.•ÈÀ
"What I mean is your taking a character like Miles that not many people know and the your throwing in other character but only one of them the general public knows, my opinion is audience based which is why I'm saying it doesn't give an audience the chance of having a movie with just Miles and getting to know him rather than the audience having to read up on important comic book lore. If they're trying to make the movie about Miles do it don't throw in other Spider-People who not that many people know, it'll be confusing to the audience into who the protagonist is, I'm probably wrong, but let's just end it with me saying...guys it's just my opinion.•ÈÀ"
"If they add venom and 2099, then this would be the most beautiful treasure that God has given us.•ÈÀ"
Dray Henzie if that happens we‰Ûªre blessed to be in this timeline•ÈÀ
I am so sick of seeing Venom everywhere•ÈÀ
"Mr Kings when used in the right way, venom can be amazing•ÈÀ"
@Mr Kings everywhere? What do you mean?•ÈÀ
"Venom isnt even that cool, Carnage is the badass one.•ÈÀ"
We only have seen Venom once in theaters . . . Everywhere? What do you mean?•ÈÀ
Would love to see that but i kinda doubt it. But 2099...._Ùª•ÈÀ
Mr Kings cause people are hyped including me to see venom after years of his last appearance in the OG Spider-Man trilogy hoping this venom would be  satisfying and awesome but I get it I been seen a lot of venom•ÈÀ
"He‰Ûªs been in mostly every Spider-Man game including Marvel‰Ûªs Spider-Man, and soon to be Marvel‰Ûªs Spider-Man 2. I haven‰Ûªt been keeping up with the comics but I‰Ûªm sure he either has a solo comic or is a big character in one of the many Spider-Man runs going right now. He has a solo movie too.•ÈÀ"
1:48 steve rogers too•ÈÀ
"Look's great. Tobey's Spider-man (the best Spider-man in my opinion) better have a cameo, especially with that reference at 0:11•ÈÀ"
Good work Sony Pictures!!•ÈÀ
Spiderpig makes me laugh so much•ÈÀ
The best part has to be the part where he says he did a Christmas album•ÈÀ
"I really don't like the way they made Peter look. He looks weird, sounds off but I think it's a great change for an older spiderman. If insomniac was able to make an older peter super well then these guys will probably do the same.•ÈÀ"

I legitimately thought this was Spider-Man PS4 DLC...•ÈÀ
I didn‰Ûªt know I wanted this•ÈÀ
Tbh why does every trailer  spoils a lot of the movie•ÈÀ
Because you should be able to forget much of this by Christmas.•ÈÀ
Bear_Bear how does the these trailer spoil anything.•ÈÀ
Krystal Myth you right•ÈÀ
If this is all about alternate versions of Spiderman then where's the friendly neighborhood symbiote version?! The one that doesn't eat people's heads but loves pork chops. _ÙĞ_Ù÷Ü•ÈÀ
What do you mean the symbiote looking one is spiderman noir•ÈÀ
@alia booley But I wanted a more obnoxious & scary one like the tongue lashing Venom but more kid friendly though.•ÈÀ
@The King Of Waffles oh OK thats cool too•ÈÀ

"Who else saw the tit of Mary Jane in 2:01Nobody else? Just me? Ok•ÈÀ"
Yay i can't wait to see the movie this december•ÈÀ

mY MAN JOHN MULANEY OUT HERE•ÈÀ
who is he in this movie?•ÈÀ
Sgt. Pancakes he voices spider-ham•ÈÀ
"There are so many different Spidey costumes I wanna see. I sure hope they have a scene where a whole bunch of them cross paths, even if it's for a few seconds. Like 2099, Scarlet, Big Time, etc.•ÈÀ"
"O please!!!!! I want to see the movie, but, this trailer change my opinion, see the old peter parker of 2002, and the spiderman of years 1800s, the pig spiderman of warner????? Please! !!!!! I believe that movie was just for spidergwen, miles morales, and a actual peter parker, by i see dont, and that is one of always reasons, marvel dont agree mee!!!•ÈÀ"

Who is the anime spider-girl?•ÈÀ
for the first time a decent  looking movie trailer from sony.•ÈÀ
"Looks like another movie to be hyped for, especially with my new love for Spidey. And with Miles being the main character, and all the other Spideys, this looks fun. Like Lego Batman Movie kind of fun. Peter was meh for me though, hopefully he'll be be alright.•ÈÀ"
Look there's a Spider - Pig (Ham) I hope having a black Spider - Man doesn't seem too far fetched to y'all no more•ÈÀ

He should be Miles Morales. Like if you agree.•ÈÀ
A cartoon???? Yeah don't care about this ......•ÈÀ
What‰Ûªs wrong with cartoons? This movie has a really unique style to it.•ÈÀ
@michaelcritic there for kids !!!!•ÈÀ
Anomalisa is an animated movie that isn‰Ûªt for kids. There‰Ûªs graphic sex scenes and life lessons to be learned for all ages. You sir do not understand movies at all.•ÈÀ
"@michaelcritic this looks like it's straight off Nickelodeon!!! I love the Simpson's, South park but I can't get into these sort of cartoons as a adult !!!•ÈÀ"
Who cares if it‰Ûªs for kids? I can enjoy a movie like Deadpool 2 or Blade Runner 2049 just as much as I can enjoy Big Hero 6.•ÈÀ
"@michaelcritic that's the problem with men in 2018 !!! All these man baby's watching kids cartoons ( my little pony, anime ) collecting toys , playing video games !!! Men's testosterone is dropping every year ; modern men are basically women !!!!! As a grown Australian male I don't have any time for kids television ! No offence to you•ÈÀ"
"How manly you are isn‰Ûªt affected by watching an animated movie. Also, what‰Ûªs wrong with being a woman? You shouldn‰Ûªt push people to be more ‰ÛÏmanly‰Û because you can‰Ûªt be less manly from watching an animated film. You should enjoy life more and stop crying about testosterone.•ÈÀ"
"@michaelcritic what isn't wrong with modern women !!!!!!????? If  like being a "" manly"" man and I miss when it was celebrated and masculinity was revered !! Now it's consider toxic and now we have a generation of cuck soy boy betas who haven't developed past being 11 ! And the epidemic of single mothers and never been shown how to be a man is the cause !! Thanks feminism!!!!!!•ÈÀ"

The best character in this is Spider HAM•ÈÀ
"At least I think I saw the Raimi suit. Also Peter Porker is always a win. Although 2099 would be nice, maybe a end credits scene sequel setup?•ÈÀ"
John Mulaney playing as spider ham is by far the funniest thing here.•ÈÀ

Spider-Ham debued in the comics 24 years before the SImpsons made that dumb joke.  Spider-ham has nothing at all to do with Spider-Pig other than being pig like.  Spider Ham isn't even technically a pig.  He's a spider that got bitten like a pig and now resembles one.  Comics are weird.•ÈÀ
From the Simpsons movie lol•ÈÀ
"Meme Insider you said spider pig instead of spider hamFBI OPEN UP•ÈÀ"
Spider pig spider pig.. it does everything a spider pig does•ÈÀ
Meme Insider spider-ham*•ÈÀ

He's New in Town•ÈÀ

@catwhowalksbyhimself tf?•ÈÀ
"It's Peter Porker Spider-Ham.He attacand he protec•ÈÀ"
"@Djoseph11230 look it up on wikipedia or the Marvel wiki.  Everything I said is absolutely true.  Because, comic books.•ÈÀ"
Peter porker maaa d00d•ÈÀ
Did no one watch the simpsons?•ÈÀ
@Ludicolo The Simpsons has nothing to do with this.  Spider-Pig was in the comics  over 20 years before that Simpson's joke.•ÈÀ
"@eenid Kuslov Yes, we know about the Simpson's movie.  Spider Ham was in the comics 24 years before the Simpsons movie.  People saying this is a Simpson's reference ARE wrong.•ÈÀ"
It‰Ûªs Spider-Ham you uncultured swine!•ÈÀ
Does what ever a Spider-Ham does•ÈÀ
"Lol imagine they asked Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland to voice act in this movie•ÈÀ"
Kanahaiyah it's a Christmas miracle•ÈÀ
That'd more likely happen if this is a success & they make a sequel•ÈÀ
There's probably a cameo from at least one of them•ÈÀ
Do we really need more Andrew Garfield? Lets forget it happend and enjoy Tobey's and Tom's versions.•ÈÀ
Tobey reference is in this filml•ÈÀ
They better.•ÈÀ
"I was really on the fence about this, not being a comic guy it was hard for me to wrap my head around more than one Spiderman. But after seeing this and the talent they have portraying everyone, this looks like a must see•ÈÀ"
Put this on trending  @youtube•ÈÀ
Yea! Spider ham!!•ÈÀ
How did I know spider ham was gonna be in this•ÈÀ
Guess they haven't finished the lip sincing or something•ÈÀ
Frame rate looks busted•ÈÀ
Pause then go to 1:38•ÈÀ
"Oh hi my name is gwen follow meoh ok•ÈÀ"
I like how they had tobey Spider-Man scenes. Should put Garfield‰Ûªs scenes in there too•ÈÀ
The train stopping scene was from : Spider-Man 2•ÈÀ
Ffs now there divercyfying spiderman•ÈÀ
The entire cast of thia movie is what has me most excited•ÈÀ
"Someone please tell me, doesn't it make more sense for the SPIDER MAN to have webs shoot from his body rather than from devices he wears on his wrists?Am i wrong here?Am i thinking backwards?Because I've heard folks say its dumb he can make the webs himself.So heightened senses, wall crawling, super strength, and a more agile body are top priority over having the one ability of a spider people even care or know about?Why would he get all that baggage but have to create artificial webbing?I'm actually curious.•ÈÀ"
I honestly think there should be more spidermen•ÈÀ
Why is Kingpin involved with a collider?•ÈÀ
Hyped for this movie•ÈÀ
ORIGINAL SPIDERMAN LOOKS MANLY AND VERY HOT•ÈÀ
All i had to see was Spider Man: Noir to know i need to see this movie•ÈÀ
And the voice of Spider-Man noir is none other than Nicolas cage•ÈÀ
Reminder: this is the studio that made the emoji movie.•ÈÀ
"Every studio has at least one disgustingly bad movie, different creatives steering the wheel on this.•ÈÀ"
Uh ok.•ÈÀ
The frames•ÈÀ
I'm only seeing it for Spider ham and spiderman•ÈÀ
"1:36HmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmNew waifu?•ÈÀ"
TAKUMAN 53 Spider-Man Noir? Definitely top tier Waifu material.•ÈÀ
"So does this film's Peter Parker represent an alternate reality of Tobey's Spider-Man? It plays out almost exactly the same, with a few differences here and there•ÈÀ"
"This movie looks Amazing, Spectacular, Superior, Ultimate....you get the idea.•ÈÀ"
"I don't know what it is about this art style, but I get motion sick every time I watch one of the trailers. Which is a shame, because the movie looks good, but I honestly don't think I could watch a full-length version of this, at least in theaters. Maybe when they release it on Blu-Ray and I can pause every time I get nauseous I'll give it a try.•ÈÀ"
Why doesn‰Ûªt peter know Gwen?•ÈÀ
she has her mask on.•ÈÀ
"Because its the Tobey version, the Andrew Garfield spiderman might if hes in•ÈÀ"
Pretty sure they cut that part.•ÈÀ
Degis Johnson gwen stacy was in the tobey films.•ÈÀ
"Can't wait for this movie, it looks dope•ÈÀ"
Now THIS is Pod-Racing•ÈÀ
The animation kinda reminded me of Telltale games...•ÈÀ
My god this looks like crap•ÈÀ
Little disappointed Spiderman 2099 isn't in the movie otherwise it looks great•ÈÀ
Why is looks so laggy while animating•ÈÀ
Song in 1:52?•ÈÀ
MY GIRL PENI PARKER•ÈÀ

"Okay for all y'all who aint gone say it, i will ""FINALLY BLACK SPIDERMAN"" yes its a cartoon but we all know spideman is way cooler as a black person. Soon as they make a real life spiderman who is black its fina be lit!•ÈÀ"
People say Miles is wearing Jordan‰Ûªs. He‰Ûªs wearing Nikes!•ÈÀ

"Alexander Lee ‰ÛÏRRGH. Why does everyone... HAM. Spider-HAM. The play on words is REALLY OBVIOUS, guys.‰Û     -Spider-Ham, in one of the Spider-Verse comics when someone started singing this (I forgot which one)•ÈÀ"
@naturalleaf545 they call him spider pig because of a simpsons gag•ÈÀ
"@naturalleaf545 Yeah, it's kidding annoying, but the song he's singing, is from the Simpsons Movie which he pig is named Spider Pig•ÈÀ"
Alexander Lee it‰Ûªs spiderham•ÈÀ

Now this is called (awesome af)_Ù÷•ÈÀ
This movie looks great•ÈÀ
1:40 YES! SPIDER HAM!! MY DREAMS CAME TRUE!!•ÈÀ
"No Spider-man 2099 sucks, but I'm really happy we got Spider-man Noir•ÈÀ"
"i found green goblin, prowler, scorpion, and kingpin in this trailer sinister six maybe?•ÈÀ"
This would be cool as an animated series. But I don't see the quality of the animation to be cinema worthy.•ÈÀ
Song?•ÈÀ

That's Peni Parker•ÈÀ
Oscarman97 overwatch fans r gonna love her•ÈÀ
"I'm calling it, Peter Parker is from the Sam Rami trilogy and Gwen is from the Mark Webb duology•ÈÀ"
Fox_JAo Does some stuff The train scene definitely gave me the raimi vibe•ÈÀ
"Yeah, except in Mark Webb's duology Gwen didn't have powers and also died. Other that that, good guess.•ÈÀ"
"Kamil Magomedov True but in the cancelled The Amazing Spider-Man 3, there was supposed to be a clone of Gwen with spider powers that would obviously be called Spider-Gwen. I think that after the ending of TASM2, those events did happen, even if we didn't see it happen•ÈÀ"
"Anyway I hope my theory is true so that we can see the aftermath of those 2 continuities. In fact, on the next original Sam Rami movie anniversary, I will be doing a stop motion of what the 4th movie was gonna be like.•ÈÀ"
Both of he new trailers I was watching at school•ÈÀ
"So Miles, Peter, Noire, Gwen, Ham and the kid with a robot.Most ambitious Spider Man crossover since Shattered Dimensions•ÈÀ"
I...LOVE........THIS!!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
"2:09 Officer, I love youWait whatLol I died _Ù_£_Ù÷É•ÈÀ"

We need more animation like this :D•ÈÀ
Incredible teaser... Waiting to see this...•ÈÀ
Nicholas Cage voicing Noir? Hell yeah•ÈÀ
This is probably the closest we‰Ûªll get to Spider-Man 4•ÈÀ
Yo I just want to hear that spidey Christmas album !!!•ÈÀ
Doesn't that ice cream remind anyone of the sonic one because of the eyes being weird. Btw I know there a spider man ice cream•ÈÀ

Was that wakanda at the end•ÈÀ
Looks absolutely incredible. It definately has the potential to be the best Spider-Man movie of all time•ÈÀ
0:10 tobeys spiderman referance•ÈÀ
"What...no Spider-Punk, no 2099 Spiderman....disappointing. BUT, this looks good, and I'm obviously going to see it, lol.•ÈÀ"

DAY ONE•ÈÀ
Hah the little pig•ÈÀ
Spiderman is my idol since I was a little kid•ÈÀ
I still can‰Ûªt believe that the studio who did the emojis movie created this•ÈÀ
pause at 1:39 and you can see Ps4 spidey suit _Ù¥á•ÈÀ
1:39 my reaction to no Spider Man 2099•ÈÀ
I got shattered dimensions vibes•ÈÀ
Is spider-pig a reference to The Simpsons lol?•ÈÀ
Noir Spider-Man looks sick :O•ÈÀ
No... NO...  NO WAY SPIDERMAN NOIR IS HERE? HE'S MY FAVORITE INCARNATION OF SPIDERMAN!!!•ÈÀ
OMG! SPIDER-PIG! YES !!•ÈÀ
"@2:20 Spider PigSpider PigDoes whatever a spiderpig canCan he swing, no he can't,He's a pigCome onnnnnn.... Here comes the spider pig•ÈÀ"
Yes Spiderman noir•ÈÀ
cant wait for wulff den to make a video on this•ÈÀ
Wakanda ? 2:28•ÈÀ
"I was looking through some old photos and this looks very, uh... similar...•ÈÀ"
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO SM3 that scene comes to my mind in exactly moment.•ÈÀ
Not expecting much from this movie considering their last animated movies.•ÈÀ
"I think we only have one Spider-Man missing from the group, Spider-Man 2099•ÈÀ"
Bee Maister yeah•ÈÀ
"Bee Maister Yup, hopefully they can add Tobeys Spider-Man in, that would be cool.•ÈÀ"
Bee Maister RIP Miguel•ÈÀ
+LEGO MINUTE who's Miguel?•ÈÀ
"Bee Maister Miguel O‰ÛªHara.. Spider-Man 2099.. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HIM, MATE•ÈÀ"
Son JoJo lol•ÈÀ
We also might be missing spider-venom.•ÈÀ
@TheDude107 I mean with those blatant references...it could very well BE the Raimi Spider-Man...just older.•ÈÀ
"+Son JoJo oh.Sorry I don't know that much about The expansive Spider-Man lore.•ÈÀ"
"Ben Reilly, Scarlet Spider•ÈÀ"
"@Daddy Long Legs Man yeah he could, or we could hear Toby himself in the movie. I'm still crossing my fingers on Tony as Uncle Ben in the MCU•ÈÀ"
"@J Arnett Much as I'd love that, I'm pretty sure Toby is long done with this franchise...and if the video games are anything to go by, he's not that great a voice actor as he is a regular actor.•ÈÀ"
He's got to be next. I want to see a Live action 2099 so bad. But with animation like this I'd be good with it too.•ÈÀ
"+Magneto that's what I was thinking!!!!We're also missing iron spider, spider X, Spider-Punk, Spider-Girl and Spider-Woman.•ÈÀ"
Superior Spiderman?•ÈÀ
Yeah and I want to see him because he is the first alternate spiderman I knew•ÈÀ
You must not read comics if you think we're only missing one spidey lmao. _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
exactly 2099 is part of the big 3•ÈÀ
"But what we really miss is supaidaman. He was in the comics, so why not in the film?•ÈÀ"
Yeah it feels wrong without him•ÈÀ
Capitan Britain Spider-Man anyone?•ÈÀ
So basically these are all the different possibilities of who the spider could have bit and all these possibilities are living in different dimensions. These are all parallel universes i guess? Thats my theory anyway.•ÈÀ
"Are you trying to insinuate that this Spider-Man is the same one from the Raimi films?EDIT: After rewatching the trailer, there are some differences in the Raymi references. It seems like this one is a goofy mashup of the Raymi  films universe and the Ultimate Spider-Man comic book universe.•ÈÀ"
Cripple Jesus yes•ÈÀ
He's a mix of raimi and amazing. Both Sony Spiderman's. Theyre combining them.•ÈÀ
Krystal Myth it‰Ûªs trash not the movie but spiderman•ÈÀ
Tears of joy in my eyes when i saw that.•ÈÀ
"Krystal Myth there was no reference to the awful amazing spiderman films, only the sam raimi films.•ÈÀ"
It‰Ûªs just a reference lol. Just because it isn‰Ûªt Tobey doesn‰Ûªt mean it‰Ûªs bad.•ÈÀ
"@Jojo 1961 the comic books, not the movies.•ÈÀ"
Cripple Jesus ohhh ok then.•ÈÀ
"Cripple Jesus reading that dude comment again, he is literally talking about the amazing spiderman films.•ÈÀ"
"@Jojo 1961 Yeah, I didn't notice that it first. Sorry. But this definitely has nothing to do with those films. It's a combination of Raymi Spider-Man and at the Ultimate Spider-Man comics.•ÈÀ"
do animals talk because I don't want to freak him out•ÈÀ
Faints•ÈÀ
Awkwardly look at each other•ÈÀ
I'm genuinely sad they used Spider-ham.•ÈÀ
Ian Bailey yeah they need like uh.. Miguel•ÈÀ
"Miguel is awesome, but I'm kinda concerned that the story will get bloated with all the different characters.•ÈÀ"
Nooooooo! They made him black _Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷_•ÈÀ
HYPPPPEEEE•ÈÀ
"NewNoir SPIDER MANPig Spider whatever•ÈÀ"
Peter Parker in black•ÈÀ
Not meaning to be racist but why is Spiderman black in this one?•ÈÀ
That's the Spider-Man of the Ultimate universe. In this universe Peter is dead•ÈÀ
Does anyone know the name of the song played near the beginning•ÈÀ
Hammer head is in the background at 1:40•ÈÀ
Niceeeee i will look it no matter what•ÈÀ
Lmao the Spider-Man 2 references•ÈÀ
It will be great.•ÈÀ
Okay I know every Spider-man/Spider-girl in this trailer...aside from the little Asian girl with the spider-man robot. Anybody know who she is?•ÈÀ
"She's called Peni Parker, originally introduced in the Spider-Verse comics•ÈÀ"
"Oscarman97 Okay thanks, I know a lot of the different versions of Spider-man, but she‰Ûªs one I‰Ûªve never seen before.•ÈÀ"
voy a llorar :''''D•ÈÀ
Please be good! _Ù___Ù_•ÈÀ
Woof !! Superb•ÈÀ
Peni is so fucking cute my heart grew three sizes this day. :')•ÈÀ
My only complaint is that SP//DR is no longer an Evangelion.•ÈÀ

Spiderman looks like a 56 yr old•ÈÀ
Why cartoon serious we not in 80s•ÈÀ
"I hope this movie bombs so sony will stop, sick of their bullshit•ÈÀ"
I hope I'm not the only one who noticed that awesome Black Panther reference.•ÈÀ
Umer Qazi where?•ÈÀ
"At 2:29 , it's a reference to one of the Black Panther posters of him looking out at Wakanda•ÈÀ"
"Is this a Prank? this can't be made by Sony, looks waaaay too good.•ÈÀ"
Loved those 3 Raimi references. Made me chuckle at the car one•ÈÀ
looks good•ÈÀ
1:39 Insomniac Spidey logo _Ù÷ Now all we need is the Raimi suit _Ù÷â (Trilogy references are in trailer)•ÈÀ
"AwesomeAmazingSpectacularUltimate•ÈÀ"
"And... A Anime Spider Girl...åÁThis movie have everything!•ÈÀ"
LMAO. Joy to the world (That I just saved)....... really spidey?•ÈÀ
"Having that same ‰ÛÏI love you‰Û joke in this trailer as well was totally worth it for the ‰ÛÏOfficer, I love you.‰Û payoff later. _Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
Peter Parker looks like an idiot in this movie•ÈÀ
I already love this movie's Peter parker•ÈÀ
0:11 Sam Rami Spiderman reference•ÈÀ
Wish there were more spider men but who knows time will tell•ÈÀ
I love spider man noir•ÈÀ
Where's Miguel O' Hara?•ÈÀ
"I know right, its like Sony are cherry picking which ones to have for their chosen humour and tone rather than fully using the Spider Verse roster of characters. I mean having Peter, Miles, and Gwen is nice but they are the popular adaptations, whilst Spider Ham, and Peni Parker look like they are set to rehash Sony's tired humour.Sucks really, could have used more Spider men/women but Sony doesn't want to•ÈÀ"
It's like Sony is putting too much effort into being funny.•ÈÀ
Into the Pizza-Verse•ÈÀ
Whos the detective spider man?•ÈÀ
spiderman noir•ÈÀ
This is Sony apologising for the Emoji Movie•ÈÀ
Yet another spider-man .stop milking fans!•ÈÀ
There's also an anime girl in a Spider-Man movie!•ÈÀ
Cant wait•ÈÀ
"I have no faith Venom isn't gonna suck, but I really want this to do well•ÈÀ"
I can't tell if this looks good or not.•ÈÀ
Alright i guess I‰Ûªll see it as long as Gwen is not some kind of feminist•ÈÀ
Is this a joke•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
I AM GAY FOR GWEN STACEY•ÈÀ
I can't believe that Nicolas Cage voices Spider-man noir.•ÈÀ
WAIT WHAT•ÈÀ
Hope he doesn't turn to dust this time...•ÈÀ
"Dont care about this, the real question is when we will get pakistani Batman?•ÈÀ"
"forced multicultural spidershit, because why should you let great things the way they are ? next year I'm hoping to see a black superman.and I'm not being racist, I only hate vegans :))•ÈÀ"
Why does Spider-Ham sound like JonTron?•ÈÀ

Was that a Black Panther reference at the end?•ÈÀ
No you marveltard•ÈÀ
But honestly what was it then?•ÈÀ

Man I‰Ûªm so fuckin hyped. I think this is what will redeem Sony (especially after The Emoji Movie)•ÈÀ
This animation is like nothing else.... it's awesome _Ù÷µ•ÈÀ
Reminds me a lot of the Lego Movie animation style•ÈÀ
Wait are they actually referring to The Original Spider-Man movie series wow sony I can‰Ûªt wait to watch this•ÈÀ
I like they reference the Sam Rami in the beginning.•ÈÀ
And alsoo the reference to the new ps4 suit by 1:39 you could see a fast glimpse•ÈÀ

How do you guys feel about Michael B Jordan playing miles morale in a live-action Spider-Man movie•ÈÀ
"Michael would be awesome, but I think a younger actor would do better as Miles. I think Michael would feel too old•ÈÀ"
Hope this is a joke•ÈÀ
This looks dope!•ÈÀ
Is perfect!!! _Ù÷_ÙÔÎ•ÈÀ
Spider Ham and Noir gg•ÈÀ
I didn't really have faith in this movie but after seeing this trailer I now do.•ÈÀ
I thought Spider-Man 2099 was gonna appear _Ù¥á•ÈÀ
I know what I'm watching•ÈÀ
1:10 _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
So the Peter Parker in Into the Spider-Verse is the Spider-Man in the Tobey Maguire movies?•ÈÀ
Alex Martinez I think they're combining both the 1st series and 2nd series Spider-Man into one with giving him an older Andrew Garfield Spider-Man personality...just my assumption btw•ÈÀ
Alex Martinez this Parker has mechanical web-shooters.•ÈÀ
Lew Archer 1949 Right just like Andrew Garfield Spider-Man•ÈÀ
@Lew Archer 1949 Maybe later on in his years Raimi Spider-Man developed mechanical Web Shooters in case his powers crap out on him again like in Spider-Man 2?•ÈÀ
"They're combining both of the spiderverses they had rights to. That's who this one is. So in a way somethit entirely new, but yes you know its roots.•ÈÀ"
"@Daddy Long Legs Man that makes no sense. His organic web-shooters did not ""give up on him"", he just gave up on being Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
"Yeah but, Spider Pig is the MAIN hero here•ÈÀ"
"@Kamil Magomedov seems like you need to rewatch Spider-Man 2 then, because he gave up on being Spider-Man because his powers were failing him. Like, nearly half an hour was dedicated to powerless Peter Parker in the film.•ÈÀ"
"@Daddy Long Legs Man I think you misunderstood the message of the movie. Peter's life is going downhill: he's failing his classes, he gets fired, his relationship with Harry and MJ is getting worse all the time. And all because he chooses Spider-Man routine over Peter Parker routine. Hence why he starts to doubt whether it's even worth being a hero or not. Which is precisely when his powers start failing him. Literally watch any analysis of this movie on YouTube and you'll hear the same thing.•ÈÀ"
december is going to be special•ÈÀ

Peni Parker was such a weird choice imo. Would have loved to see Spidernan 2099 or maybe Ben Reilly idk there's a lot•ÈÀ
Yeah but where's my boy Spider-Punk?•ÈÀ

Black spiderman cool•ÈÀ

Mmmm nah.•ÈÀ
A black spider Man cuz 2018•ÈÀ
Miles has been around since 2011.•ÈÀ
_Ù÷I LOVE IT!!_Ù÷•ÈÀ
Did they just make an old episode into a movie ?•ÈÀ
Why only on Christmas?•ÈÀ
"This looks like so much fun, will we get a spider-dance though?•ÈÀ"

Nick Miller.. Nick Miller...from streets of Chicago _Ù÷_•ÈÀ
Looks like a good amount of villains are going to be in this film...I‰Ûªm excited!•ÈÀ
"Although im kinda salty that there isnt a live action Miles Morales movie, i really cant be mad, the animation is beautiful. I wonder why they arent including the Scarlet Spider.•ÈÀ"
"We could possibly get Miles in the MCU in a few years. In one of the later phases maybe, when Tom's Spider-Man is a bit older, and when the MCU is vastly different to how it is now.•ÈÀ"
@LeanGreenMeme Tom and Spiderpals vs the Sinister Six would be awesome.•ÈÀ
Jean Valverde pretty sure Scarlett spider is in the same universe as peter Parker and at this point he is dead or somewhere else.•ÈÀ
"Miles Morales is the ""nephew around these parts"" that Donald Glover was talking about in Homecoming•ÈÀ"
Miles morales is literally peter parler if he were black.I dont get the point especially since hes a boring character.•ÈÀ
"@Anthony Batista boring character when his comics are selling more than Peter parkers in the recent years? He's not a clone of Peter but black, he has his own story if your bothered to actually read it•ÈÀ"
+abrelosojosputa Miles is a great character but that's just not true.•ÈÀ
Jean Valverde he is a clone not an alternative universe Spider-Man also they don‰Ûªt wanna remind people of the clone saga•ÈÀ
I wonder if this is the same Spider-Man from the Sam Rami films•ÈÀ
1:38 ‰ÛÓ look behind Aunt May (I‰Ûªm assuming that‰Ûªs her)...•ÈÀ
"Sony, please dont screw this up...•ÈÀ"
1:37 Shadman coming for you.•ÈÀ
Peter Porker. I'm so in.•ÈÀ
"The art style is fantastic Look at the background and subjectsWhoever draws this is talented)•ÈÀ"
I in love with the animation style. Especially the different art styles with each of the Spider-Men (and Women)•ÈÀ
The animation style is just spectacular•ÈÀ
Amazing even•ÈÀ
maybe even friendly neighborhood? JK hahaha it is very bold and refreshing to see though!•ÈÀ
"I love how the different spider people are drawn in different various designs, 3d, 2d, comic book-y, and even anime-y•ÈÀ"
It's definitely superior to most other animations out there•ÈÀ
Dare I say Ultimate ?•ÈÀ
Elora Maxwell will never beat the. 1984 transformers tho•ÈÀ
To each their own but I think it looks really horrible at times. I don't like the laggy and annoying low framerate animation style they are using and there is this ugly overuse of what looks to be chromatic aberration everywhere. The most ugly effect used in games and movies.•ÈÀ
Cool•ÈÀ
Its like stop motion claymation to me. I agree its a retro style i love.•ÈÀ
Spectacular Spiderman•ÈÀ
"@Merwanor thank youFinally someone who thought exactly what i did•ÈÀ"
"The TRUE Spider-Man Is Here.https://youtu.be/4ZteJ474Baw•ÈÀ"
@Merwanor I love the low framerate look. The blending with 2d animation effects is very beautiful. The animation style is very classic. Makes them feel tangible. Like they're made of clay. If you will.•ÈÀ
"Dare I say, it could even be Superior to most animations.•ÈÀ"
"Merwanor luckily this ""issue"" seems to be fixed. There's a short piece of the movie at the end of Venom's credits, and it's sooo smooth. Let's just hope the whole movie is like that, although the various frame rates are not a problem to me, I totally get your point!•ÈÀ"
It's like they animated a comic. I love it.•ÈÀ
"Agree! I'm very excited, can't  wait to watch it with boxxy software.•ÈÀ"
Art direction is beautiful. Miles is so cool•ÈÀ
"2:27 - Cheeky BP reference? Okay, I see ya Sony.•ÈÀ"

Yessssss Nic Cage!!!!•ÈÀ
Spider Pig! If that's not a Simpsons reference...•ÈÀ
still_guns It's not. Spider-ham has been a thing since the 1980s•ÈÀ
In for Mulaney as spiderpig•ÈÀ
i literally cant wait•ÈÀ
BROOKLYN FOREVER!!•ÈÀ
Is that Tobey McGuire spider man?•ÈÀ
yh•ÈÀ
I saw Nior SpiderMan and I just love this movie 1000% more because of that•ÈÀ
"Oh yeh... This movie's gonna be amazing.•ÈÀ"
0:10 if guys remember this scene like this comment•ÈÀ
I genuinely don't think this is gonna be a good film but my fucking god I'm gonna see it for this animation!!! Honestly never seen anything like it!•ÈÀ
"spider pig spider pig, does what ever a spider pig does...•ÈÀ"
It actually Looks ....fucking amazing•ÈÀ
Why do i have a feeling this is going to be a bad movie•ÈÀ

After playing the SpiderMan Game I can‰Ûªt wait for this movie!•ÈÀ

"I wasnt interested with the 1st trailer, but this has got me excited for this movie now.•ÈÀ"
NOIR•ÈÀ
Wow they even got a reference to SPIDER-MAN 2!•ÈÀ
Supa Saiyan-jin where?•ÈÀ
And one....•ÈÀ
@Shawn Altamar here 0:10•ÈÀ
The Sam Rami Spiderman reference.•ÈÀ
@Shawn Altamar the scene where Peter is stopping the train is a scene from spiderman 2 the greatest spiderman movie of all time•ÈÀ
And the upside down kiss from Spiderman 1•ÈÀ
This looks good•ÈÀ
AMAZING!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
Peter Parker looks a lot like Tobey Maguire and many elements are from the original Spiderman series . I wish he would had given voice to his character.•ÈÀ
From the teaser this seemed like an exploration of miles story and a step towards seeing if Marvel could do mature animation (looks like miles dad was supposed to be killed as he looks at a gravestone) but seeing this I cant help but feel it has been zombified into a Christmas kids cash grab...this  is  so  sad  .•ÈÀ
i lost it an anime spiderman•ÈÀ
Too.........many..........Spider-Man...........•ÈÀ
At first I didn‰Ûªt think this was going to be very good... now THIS trailer?!?! I will be seeing this 100%! I love all the real world humor and references and seeing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey and not just miles morales makes me happy.•ÈÀ
So peter will survive and hopefully will have a big role as in a role equal to miles in the sense hes miles partner and has a role as big as him•ÈÀ
Spider-Gwen looks low key hot in Into The Spider-Verse they did a great job with her design.•ÈÀ
Nice reference to Tobey and Andrew moments•ÈÀ
Not sure•ÈÀ
"Spider-Man Noir in a Spider-Man movie?10/10 before I've even seen it.•ÈÀ"

"honestly can‰Ûªt wait, this looks dope and hilarious•ÈÀ"
"Ok boys, I'm pretty hyped. If this is anything less than the greatest super-hero movie ever made I'm gonna be disappointed.•ÈÀ"
Spiderman PS4 makes a cameo at 1:38 like so people can see•ÈÀ
"Woo que emocion!! poder ver a Spiderman,Miles morales, Spider Gwen,Spiderman Noir, Spider Ham y Peni Parker!!! juntos!!.   Esa pelicula no me la pierdo por nada!•ÈÀ"
Who else saw the Sam Raimi Trilogy references?•ÈÀ
Why is he black•ÈÀ
Because he wants to be and als9 he is from a different dimension•ÈÀ
Is this realese in hindi ??•ÈÀ
"Pause your vid and go to 1:46 best frame , and did I mention, SPIDER-MAN FUCKING NOIR!?!?•ÈÀ"

"I want ""SPIDER-HAM V SPIDER-PIG: DAWN OF PORK""•ÈÀ"
I‰Ûªm pretty sure the inheritors are going to be the main vampire baddies in this movie just like in the comics•ÈÀ
I love that the pig is john mulaney•ÈÀ
"Wait so is this the same Spider-Man from Sam Rami‰Ûªs Spider-Man Trilogy? If so, I wish they had Tobey Maguire voicing the character in this.•ÈÀ"
It isn't•ÈÀ
"Sleepy Cerberus The train scene though, must be Raimi Spidey•ÈÀ"
TheDude107 it's just a reference it isn't tobeys Spider-Man•ÈÀ
"Probably not, just references. But Toby could show up.•ÈÀ"
The only comic book turned movie that makes sense. They didn‰Ûªt change the characters to fit a PC narrative.•ÈÀ

"This movie looks awesome! Also, if they want to be more meta they can mention Ben Riley and the clone saga, or make a cameo of Tom Holland. Spider-Man has too many alternate selves and clones that would scare J. Jonah Jamison.•ÈÀ"
I knew The French Edgey one and spider ham were going to be in this but why an anime one?•ÈÀ
By the way does you guys remember the peter parker gravestone from the first teaser?•ÈÀ
Joshua Andrea Peter is supposed to be dead in Miles' universe. Or at least he is in the comics.•ÈÀ
Anime spider man? _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
"I absolutely love the animation in this film. It‰Ûªs 3dimentional, but still has comic books vibes. It has a touch of 2d animation that makes it look beautiful. And some of the spider mans have completely different art styles. 10/10 in visuals•ÈÀ"
Is it me or does this Peter Parker look like Andrew Garfield?•ÈÀ
Seriouslyyyy!!!!!!!!! Gwen Stacy as spider woman _Ù÷¨•ÈÀ
"""only on the big screen Christmas""? that's a little vague, makes it sounds like it will only be in theaters on christmas day, and if that suspicion is true im going to be upset.•ÈÀ"

"Miles ain't that had as of late, look at ps4! I think it did the concept well and i think this film will too•ÈÀ"

@kemal bregas Dewantoro yeah but OP was talking in past tense. We probably won't see any of that crossover for quite a while.•ÈÀ

"She is actually sporting a legit punk style (which is why it actually look good), which existed before stupid feminist and SJW for some weird reason decided to copy it (and they don't even know how to do it right).•ÈÀ"
Women shouldn't shave their heads unless they're in the military or have cancer. And since feminism is cancer...•ÈÀ
It dosent even look like a feminist shes supposed to be punk•ÈÀ
By feminist I assume you mean hot.•ÈÀ
@Magneto spider ham is more hot•ÈÀ
Its just a punk rocker look. Sjws copied it and lost the meaning of the hair style•ÈÀ
Who else watched this WAAAAAAAY over 29 times?•ÈÀ
Now we are talking...thats what called best spiderman trailer ever•ÈÀ
Did I just see noir Spider-Man?•ÈÀ

"2:01 Wait... Waitwaitwaitwaitwait.Did this Peter's MJ die?!•ÈÀ"
"Wogle Probably not, but he's sad since he can't get back to her, being stuck in another universe and what not.•ÈÀ"
"@FN Danmark True, but from the previous trailer as well, this Peter seems not only older and ""wiser"", but more cynical of the world. Her dying (and not just leaving) could definitely be a cause of that I reckon.•ÈÀ"

Just wait and see•ÈÀ
I want Dan Givilzan to play 2099•ÈÀ
Avengers Assemble no 2099 that you know of.•ÈÀ
and yet nobody on here is mentioning Miles Morales smh•ÈÀ
Chandros Evans he just said ultimate spider man which is miles morales u fake fan•ÈÀ
How many Spider-Men is too many?•ÈÀ
"FRNZY hold up bro, I'm not a fake fan when he said ultimate Spiderman I'm thinking the animated series on Disney XD how was I supposed 2 know he was talking about Miles???? I'm a huge fan of the web slinger•ÈÀ"
Javier Pupo there's also medieval times Spiderman where's he's a knight•ÈÀ
Chandros Evans I was also kind of scratching my head at no 2099. Or Spider-Punk. Or Last Stand. Or Even Scarlet Spider.•ÈÀ
"But tbh, it's probably a good thing that they have this much, because too many characters might muddy up the story•ÈÀ"
The Nuka-Cola Man yeah then it would b all about Spiderman and not the other characters n the movie•ÈÀ
"It's alright,Spidey 2099 traveled way too far to every Dimension.•ÈÀ"
"Fearless 4 Him no, he's not?•ÈÀ"
What I was saying_Ù_£_Ù_£•ÈÀ
2099 spidey WILL be in this movie•ÈÀ
"maximiliano sintim yeah, maybe in a post-credits scene. But not as a main character.•ÈÀ"
He's probably in this•ÈÀ
I know right•ÈÀ
Avengers Assemble you mean no spider-cop now that pisses me off•ÈÀ

So... This is a good or bad thing for you?•ÈÀ
"It's a cartoon, what do you expect? You want hyper-realistic CGI to the point it looks like real actors, kinda like that Beowulf movie that sucked?•ÈÀ"

This is cool an all and I love seeing the miles spiderman in the comics but we need to get him in the avenger movies #BlackSpiderman•ÈÀ
1 year.... 3 different Spiderman..... How convenient..... This surely puts a smile on my face......•ÈÀ
See? if you're keeping Spiderman's rights this is the movie we wanna see•ÈÀ
Oh god! What did they do to Peni Parker and the Sp//der mech!? They look terrible!•ÈÀ
get rid of the anime girl and put 2099 and I'll be extremely happy•ÈÀ
Is jordon peele voiceing spider-ham? Cause he sounds like andrew from big mouth•ÈÀ
Spidermans•ÈÀ
YES ITS SPIDERHAM•ÈÀ
I will buy a ps4 and buy the game and when this movie comes out on DVD I will play it on the ps4•ÈÀ
"Man, I really hope this does well enough to get a sequel. The Spiderverse is an awesome, exciting storyline and a sequel to this origin-story movie would be able to expand so much. Such as... bringing more Spider-Men! 2099, Silk, maybe even Superior Spider-Man! Let's just hope. And go see this in theatres and support it, of course•ÈÀ"
Nah lol.•ÈÀ

"julianto triwijaya If they put too many spider-people in the movie, it would feel really bloated and with no time to develop any of them.•ÈÀ"
"FN Danmark i mean that's makes sense, i mean a lot, i just realize since the comic got too many spider people in one event i did feel it a bit, as if they were have no time to develop and just dashing trought the story :/•ÈÀ"

Nabeel Khan this is sony spiderverse not marvel studios version. They connect this world with the original spiderman movies. U can see mary jane kissing spiderman from spiderman 1 and spiderman fought on train•ÈÀ
"@Ryuzaki Raiga Emphasis on Spiderverse, because by that logic, all Spiderman films are connected to one and another.•ÈÀ"
@Ryuzaki Raiga Except he has mechanial web shooters. This is an older 616 Spider-Man. Not the Raimi Spider-Man/96283 Spider-Man.•ÈÀ

You know Spider-Ham first appeared in 1983•ÈÀ
@James Young I don't think they're real fans•ÈÀ
Awesome•ÈÀ
I have feeling this going be a spiderverse trilogy leading up to spidergeddon or part avengers serect wars.•ÈÀ
tashawn mcrae this is under sony spiderman not marvel studio.version so no avengers•ÈÀ

@Benjamin Ruggles He's just making a Simpsons reference man. -_-•ÈÀ
Manuel Alberto Romero So? If you‰Ûªre gonna make jokes know what you‰Ûªre talking about.•ÈÀ
The animation looks weird but seems like it will be ok!•ÈÀ
T R its like stop motion.•ÈÀ
@Ryuzaki Raiga yeah it's probably like 12 frame's that's my guess•ÈÀ
"And in this universe i am not Spiderman and it sucks.....we need to find the Spidey of this universe, get into work internet.•ÈÀ"
The dislikers are from another dimension too•ÈÀ

This movie looks amazing!•ÈÀ
Spider is stealing wallets with webs.•ÈÀ
"Always been a fan of Miles, but after seeing him come to life (animated wise) on PS4's Spider-Man, I really want to see more Miles. Hyped for this!•ÈÀ"
PS4‰Ûªs Spider-Man also bright Miles to live for me. So glad I played that game.•ÈÀ
Watch the ultimate Spiderman spiderverse episode. Sort of feels like this Miles.•ÈÀ
"Original Spiderman, Miles Spiderman, Gwen Spiderman, and even a film noir Spidey okay. But the Porky Pig Spidey and anime mecha girl spiderman threw me off. Will still watch though.•ÈÀ"
"Spider Ham is an essential to any ""Spider-Verse"" film•ÈÀ"
SPIDER PIG????!!!!!!! The Simpsons knew........•ÈÀ
Yeah spider ham is from the 80s. He existed before the simpsons did that joke•ÈÀ

Looks better than homecoming I know I'm going to get backlash but I hated homecoming why did everyone like it•ÈÀ
"that guy glubey me too, i hype myself to much by thinking marvel studio gonna do justice but they ruin it by making peter doesn't have motivation, villain are not scary at all unlike sony version and the visual its bad•ÈÀ"
"that guy glubey I loved the suit, not the story. Don‰Ûªt worry, people who love homecoming are Tom Holland fan girls so you‰Ûªre good dude.•ÈÀ"
"Uh...because that version of Spider-Man was closest to the comic book version. An opinion that even STAN LEE himself has said publicly. Seriously people, read a comic book or something. _Ù__‰Û‰ªâ•ü•ÈÀ"
"Major Glitch Suit is VERY accurate, that‰Ûªs why love the suit. However he‰Ûªs basically getting help from Tony Stark, which didn‰Ûªt happen in the comics. The only time he got help from Stark in the comics was fighting off Carnage.!•ÈÀ"
Also not many people liked the whole multiple villains thing that Sony did in the previous Spider-man movies so Marvel got a plus on that.•ÈÀ
@TheDude107 not going to argue with that you are 1000% correct•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham is in the movie! My prayers have been answered!•ÈÀ
"You are weird, it isn't a bad thing. But Spider-Ham, really? Spider-Ham, so Sony is going DC with live action and animation. Animation awesome live action take it or leave it•ÈÀ"
You‰Ûªre comment is everything I dislike about the world we live in.•ÈÀ
There's a comic version where The X-Bugs & Fantastic Furr make their debut.•ÈÀ

"So, you have a problem with her hair being short? Some women don't like to have long hair, you know.•ÈÀ"
"Inugami X9 incorrect, just not a fan of those kind of hairstyles. I‰Ûªm actually not a fan of many hair trends that our poor excuse for a generation has come up with. Also no, I have no problem with Women having shorter hair. Some of my favorite fictional female characters so happen to have short hair. Stop trying to put words in my mouth and stop being a dumb little SJW and finding sexism in everything.

"Inugami X9 if you want to have a debate about what I said, then let‰Ûªs have one about what it actually said instead of what your feeble little mind thought it said.•ÈÀ"
Who is Gwen voiced by? I swear it's on the tip of my tongue.•ÈÀ
I'm pretty sure spider man noir is gonna use his powers to steal the Declaration of Independence.•ÈÀ
Umm... The train scene and him mentioning a comic book. No 4th wall anymore?? Love it•ÈÀ
Boy ho boy this is the best trailer of the year WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOWwwwwwwwwwwwww•ÈÀ
At 1:39 you can see the insomniac spider man suit behind aunt may.•ÈÀ
"the embodiment of light & darkness, so the question remains is this the ps4 Spider-Man or the 616•ÈÀ"
@Hiccup Parker I have been thinking that also•ÈÀ
the embodiment of light & darkness I hope the ps4 version replaces the 616 version sort of what DC did with the new 52•ÈÀ
the embodiment of light & darkness Dude! Nice catch. Finished that game last week!•ÈÀ
@Fearless 4 Him yeah me too got platinum trophy.•ÈÀ
Hiccup Parker It‰Ûªs not replacing him. He‰Ûªs being added to the 616 in the new Spider-Geddon #0.•ÈÀ
"@Hiccup ParkerBut with New 52, it wasn't just one character. It was the whole universe that was revamped.Insomniac's Spider-Man wouldn't just seamlessly fit in with the mainline 616 comics without another major revamp.•ÈÀ"
whoa nice catch!•ÈÀ
LeanGreenMeme maybe not but marvel could do it if they wanted•ÈÀ
Fearless 4 Him well that maybe a bad idea considering the relationships that they have with others•ÈÀ
the embodiment of light & darkness good eye•ÈÀ
"Dude, nice eye.•ÈÀ"
That‰Ûªs pretty fucking cool•ÈÀ
That is an amazing reference.•ÈÀ
After the fantastic game they made they deserve to have there suit shown in the movie.•ÈÀ
Great eye thanks for pointing that out•ÈÀ
"the embodiment of light & darkness good job, thanks for pointing that out•ÈÀ"
OKAY WHAT THE HELL•ÈÀ
WTF LETS GO•ÈÀ
I think it's the 2099•ÈÀ
@gabriel da costa e siva magalhaes boi?•ÈÀ
Hiccup Parker What the hell is 616? Is it the original suit name or what? I'm getting so confused because I remember that there was an Earth 616.•ÈÀ
"Wow, to think that you even noticed it•ÈÀ"
I don't feel so good•ÈÀ
What is the embodiemeny of light and darkness•ÈÀ
@Soupyy_ 616 is the main and original marvel universe. The 616 suit is basically the red and blue classic suit•ÈÀ
"SoiSej Makes sense, thanks.•ÈÀ"
1:42 SPIDER PIGGY•ÈÀ
Yeah that's interesting•ÈÀ
"Ive never seen any spiderman movies, but this looks awesome.•ÈÀ"

Anyone else find the animation weird?•ÈÀ
Manan Gosalia its stop motion animation. Its popular in 80's movie. I think British did with dog and human animation using clay but i forgot the title•ÈÀ
Dead Mary Jane??•ÈÀ
What?•ÈÀ
Where did you get that from•ÈÀ
Noir Spider-Man! YESSS•ÈÀ
Is Spider Man Noir gonna have a gun? That'd be cool.•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham! Good old Peter Porker!•ÈÀ
what's up with frame rate? this is highly annoying•ÈÀ
It will be in netflix?•ÈÀ
I jus love it_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷•ÈÀ
"Animation looks nice, but I don't think the film will do the Spider Verse story justice. Some things look cool like Spider Gwen and of course Peter and Miles, but others such as Spider Man Noir look strange or cherry picked from the plethorah of characters from the story to fit a certain audience and humour threshold which is always a no from me. Due to its tone I feel like they will skip past or undermine some potential for good storytelling if that makes sense(?) such as Spider Gwen's backstory and Spider Man Noir's background.•ÈÀ"
I hate it•ÈÀ
Why Though? it looks so good i love the art style•ÈÀ
it looks really odd.... i will give it a try but right now i hate the trailers•ÈÀ
No Ben Reilly? :(•ÈÀ
Noir looks fucking AWSOME!•ÈÀ
"The animation looks amazing, kinda reminds me of ""Kubo & The Two Strings""•ÈÀ"
"Where is Spider Knight, Spider 2022, and Spider man from England(i forgot the name)•ÈÀ"
spider man uk•ÈÀ
Gabriel VerÌ_ssimo yes that's the name! Just remember nowXD•ÈÀ
ok•ÈÀ
"With so many spidermen and women, will uncle Ben die those many times or are we finally past that?•ÈÀ"
Spider loli - YES YES YES!•ÈÀ
looks very good I can't wait to go see it with the family. . I like that it's a  different take on spiderman universe.•ÈÀ
Is the Prowler going to be in this?  If he is that would be so cool•ÈÀ
Superior Productions yep•ÈÀ
He is in the last trailer•ÈÀ
Try watching the trailer•ÈÀ
He's literally in the trailer lol.•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
Superior Productions yup that was him•ÈÀ
1:53•ÈÀ
"Yes, he is.•ÈÀ"
"Dude, he's in all of the trailers.•ÈÀ"
Batman?•ÈÀ
Why does Noir have a hat and trench coat?•ÈÀ
"1:39 spiderman ps4 costume behind aunt may. nice one, sony•ÈÀ"
Dubbed in Hindi•ÈÀ
The next generation of Spider man.•ÈÀ
i am waiting.... for the fun to begin on Christmas•ÈÀ
My man had the 1s on•ÈÀ
I WANNA SEE THIS AS A LIVE ACTION!  ANYONE ELSE!•ÈÀ
"No cause it limits what you can do visually and everyone needs to look realistic limiting artistic creativity, expression and the variety of shapes of the characters (Notice the contrast between some of the characters). I'd rather see all Superhero movies animated that way skin tight costumes don't seem so silly and you won't get ugly costumes that look uncomfortable, they can look buff as hell,  they can jump from building to building and flip all over without looking too cgi. Animation all the way!!!•ÈÀ"
Isn't this from the director who supports Antifa's violent actions?•ÈÀ
1:39 is that the ps4 suit in the very back??•ÈÀ
why does the animation look like it's missing a few frames•ÈÀ
"I didn't think they'd include Spider-Ham, and yet there he is.•ÈÀ"
Rick and Morty but with spiders.•ÈÀ
The different art styles are really intriguing! I cannot wait for this to come out!•ÈÀ
Take my money!!! Take it!•ÈÀ
Spider-Man 2099?!•ÈÀ
Does anyone feel the 3Dness in the Background•ÈÀ
1:43 is spiderham left handed•ÈÀ
Sony stick to this. Forget about live action. Please for the love of god.•ÈÀ
Spiderman 2 say hello•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªd be more excited if Gwen Stacy wasn‰Ûªt Spider-Man as well... wtf???•ÈÀ
If you were an actual fan you‰Ûªd know that version has existed for a while.•ÈÀ
That's been part of the comics for a long time•ÈÀ
Finally a mainstream super-hero movie that's freakin animated !!! :D I love this!•ÈÀ
WHEN IS THE GODDAM SONG FOR THIS TRAILER GOING TO BE RELEASED?•ÈÀ
Hopefully this film heavily is based around miles instead of every spider man cause if we have this much spider men in most scenes it will be bad•ÈÀ
NICK CAGE!!!•ÈÀ
No Miguel?•ÈÀ
"Ossm vdo.https://youtu.be/GeiZV9Vf35o•ÈÀ"
This feels like part 2 of the ps4 Spider-Man but miles edition•ÈÀ
The idea of the movie looks great. But that atrociously shitty frame rate is gonna give me motion sickness.•ÈÀ
Did I hear nick cage as noir spidey?•ÈÀ
Albino Gorilla Yes. Yes you did.•ÈÀ
It like watching video game movie•ÈÀ
Why is Peter an old man?•ÈÀ
SO. MANY. RAIMI CALLBACKS.•ÈÀ

DarthOliptius They‰Ûªve existed for a while.•ÈÀ
Tooooobeeyyyy•ÈÀ
This looks hella dope very well done. That Pig at the end made me laugh.•ÈÀ
gotta love the Sam Raimi references in this trailer•ÈÀ
i think this is sam raimi's spider man•ÈÀ
I think it has the sam raimi's story but with an older andrew garfield version•ÈÀ
"@‰¡GÌ÷D‰± NomadeHe has mechanial web shooters. Sam Raimi's version had organic web shooters•ÈÀ"
Ultimate gamerxx truly•ÈÀ
"Ultimate gamerxx I know right, first the stopping the train scene from Spider-Man 2 and then the iconic upside down kiss, some people are even saying this version of Spider-Man is the Sam Raimi version, personally I don't think this is true, I think the writers just added those scenes as a nice little reference and nothing more.•ÈÀ"
ikr? that was awesome. :)•ÈÀ
"Oh yes,the really good stuff.•ÈÀ"
"All of you are idiots. He isn't one of the actors grown-up, and he doesn't even seem to be Insomniac's Peter. He's just Spider-Man. Plain and simple Comic Book Peter.•ÈÀ"
Ultimate gamerxx totally do love the Raimi references•ÈÀ
If I wasn't gonna go broke with Christmas shopping I'm gonna be broke when this comes out•ÈÀ

Who is the cool black Spiderman with the detective coat?•ÈÀ
Spider-Man noire•ÈÀ
"Why are they revealing so much ?!Keep the story fresh when it releases !Stop making it look months old !•ÈÀ"
"Really hope they have the lines:""I couldn't save the Gwen in my world.""""I couldn't save the Peter in mine, so let's save each other this time.""•ÈÀ"
AHHHH!!!•ÈÀ
NOPE•ÈÀ
"Considering Peter doesn't know who Gwen is, this isn't going to happen.•ÈÀ"
"different peter, sorry•ÈÀ"
Perhaps he just doesn‰Ûªt recognize her because she‰Ûªs a teenager and the Gwen Stacy of her universe was on college maybe in her early 20s•ÈÀ
That would be beautiful.•ÈÀ
"Sadly I don't think the film will have anything like that, it would break its tone (it looks audience pandering for me in terms of humour and for some of the characters) which sucks because it would be a cool moment•ÈÀ"
i prefer spiderman to be a white man role•ÈÀ
LMAO what tf•ÈÀ
"If you're not joking. There's different universes we're there are many different spider people, with different personalities•ÈÀ"
And he is a white male role in this•ÈÀ
Black spiderman and not the cool symbiote spiderman smh•ÈÀ
Mehdi Boumadiani Miles is awesome.•ÈÀ
Its amazing.•ÈÀ
Can't wait man _Ù÷•ÈÀ

jethawk1172 Nope Spider Ham is from the 80s do your research.•ÈÀ
Benjamin Ruggles ahhh well I didn‰Ûªt know. I only just made that reference back to simpsons•ÈÀ
"Spider-Ham haha, wasn't expecting that•ÈÀ"
OMG•ÈÀ
osm•ÈÀ
"Interesting, the concept of dimensions.•ÈÀ"
"Can't lie, more hyped for this than Venom lol•ÈÀ"
Same i don't really have any interest in seeing venom. And plus i really like animated movies•ÈÀ
School Boyz I‰Ûªve always loved venom so I wanna see that more than anything but this is definitely second because miles is probably my third favorite super hero•ÈÀ
Same•ÈÀ
I'm still watching venom but I guarantee it won't b as good as this movie•ÈÀ
THIS LOOKS AMAZING OMG•ÈÀ
"Love the visual style, the story and the humor... hate the choppy frame rate. They should do an alternative smooth edition for home releases...•ÈÀ"
Nice I like how they put some scenes from spider man 2002 2004 so when toby watches it will make him happy.•ÈÀ
I like this a lot.•ÈÀ
spiderman killing it this year•ÈÀ
so many spoders im so happy•ÈÀ
15fps ?•ÈÀ
"I know the style is going for a comic feel, but the movie comes off as having a frame rate issue.•ÈÀ"
What movie isn't 30fps lol•ÈÀ
Looks like dumb alternate universe fan fiction garbage.•ÈÀ
Jesus Christ how many frames per second is this?•ÈÀ
Can't wait!!!!!•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm sorry who tf is the anime girl?•ÈÀ
"an SpiderGirl from Japan, the difference its that she actually use a MechaSpider(long history)•ÈÀ"
Sounds cool then•ÈÀ
"Wow, I'm really excited!! Had me laughing out loud!•ÈÀ"
It's still early but 2099 would be cool to see show up.•ÈÀ
"Way Better than the ""Captain Marvel"" Trailer.•ÈÀ"
Whaaa?!?!? I thought this got cancelled?•ÈÀ
Incoming comic books fans not comic enough or this isn't in the comics in the comics he did this or this happened•ÈÀ
Looks good but Kinda laggy•ÈÀ
Is the first spiderguy we see tobey mcguire? Because the scenes and the story is the same•ÈÀ
He has mechanial web shooters. Toby didn't.•ÈÀ
I'm sure it was just a cool Easter egg referencing those movies :)•ÈÀ
It's the original spiderman but older and experienced. He looks like he's in his early 30s or late 20s.•ÈÀ
KappaK It‰Ûªs kind of like in the lego Batman movie when they referenced all the different Batman movies but technically didn‰Ûªt happen•ÈÀ
"KappaK Last time we saw Tobey he was in his early 20s while this Peter is said to be in his 40s, would be cool if it were true but it‰Ûªs unlikely•ÈÀ"
@Matthew Quinn I'm pretty sure that kiss scene isn't just from the movies.•ÈÀ
"@Wobbey363 I mean yeah it's been everywhere I'd imagine being in the comics, but they showed 3 scenes from the raimi movies back to back, so I'd imagine it was just a fun nod to those movies•ÈÀ"
"Yes,he is the Original Amazing Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
at the 1:39 mark you can see the new suit from the Spiderman game in the background•ÈÀ
boring.•ÈÀ
ok this looks fine-OH MY GOSH WAS HE STOPPING THE TRAIN?! I WANT TO SEE THIS NOW!!!•ÈÀ
John Mulaney!•ÈÀ

Just 1.2M in just 5 hrs•ÈÀ
Where is the loli spiderman boss??•ÈÀ
Where is my 2099 Spidey at!•ÈÀ
This voice cast could not be any better.•ÈÀ
"Nicholas Cage as Spiderman noir..,..... Dreams do come true.•ÈÀ"
No 2099•ÈÀ
EVERY. KIND. OF. HYPE•ÈÀ
I'm seein' it for the spiderpig•ÈÀ
Seems waaaay more entertaining than Homecoming.•ÈÀ
Lego Batman but with Sony's Spiderman•ÈÀ
1:38 insomniacs spider man! In the back ground•ÈÀ
Nick Cage as Spider-Man:Noir! Yes!•ÈÀ
I came for John Mulaney and I wasn‰Ûªt disappointed•ÈÀ
The spiderman is a middle age freeloader? ‰Û¢_‰Û¢•ÈÀ
Looks good but the frame rate sucks._Ù÷â•ÈÀ
"DIAMONDGEZER that‰Ûªs the point... it‰Ûªs supposed to be like a comic book, like the pages came to life•ÈÀ"

0:12?? WTF!!! Is so stronger•ÈÀ
"Spider-Man is very strong, he is holding back when he's fighting to not kill his enemies•ÈÀ"
@Resver320 he's talking about Peter making out with MJ•ÈÀ
@Beta ray bill Jackson I think he's talking about the moment he hits the car flying toward him•ÈÀ
That makes more sense•ÈÀ
You'd be surprised how strong Spider-Man gets in a lot of books•ÈÀ
I love it <3•ÈÀ
Flashpoint?•ÈÀ
Graysons dad No.•ÈÀ
Sony should just focus on stuff like this and leave the live action movies to Marvel.•ÈÀ
qwen's dead. atleast thats what i thought•ÈÀ
"Kevin Anderson Multiple universes. In hers, she's not dead and was the one to get bit by the spider.•ÈÀ"
1:39 Is The Suit behind him the Spiderman PS4 Suit_Ù÷±_Ù÷±•ÈÀ
M Billa do you think this is that spiderman because all the suits in the background are from the game.•ÈÀ
"good eye, it might be _Ù÷¨•ÈÀ"
"Not going to see Venom, definitely going to see this _ÙÔ•ÈÀ"
"Miles: officer i love you. Miles Dad: Wait what?•ÈÀ"
"Yeah, that is what happened in the trailer...•ÈÀ"
Yeah i know.•ÈÀ
I AM SOLD ON SEEING THIS MOVIE•ÈÀ
is that WAKANDA at last where peter stands??•ÈÀ
forget Venom... i think sony should just stick to animation with their spidey-related stuff other than the one w tom holland & the mcu... leave the live action stuff to MARVEL.•ÈÀ
Let's wait and see•ÈÀ
Funk O'Matic u do realize the mcu is just Disney with rights to marvel characters•ÈÀ
Disney** u mean•ÈÀ
I'm with you on that and besides this open the door for so many possibilities.•ÈÀ
No way•ÈÀ
"Funk O'Matic I got a bad feeling about Venom. Tom Hardy already complaining his favorite scenes got cut, the director saying they always were going for PG13 knowing full well fans supported them because they promised us a hard R rating because of how well Logan & Deadpool did•ÈÀ"
xx Alvexas xx Youre right about marvel characters and all but Sony owns all rights to spiderman not disney•ÈÀ
No give Sam rami back the directing rights and let HIM take care of the action•ÈÀ
B.R. Smith That‰Ûªs... that‰Ûªs not good•ÈÀ
Agreed•ÈÀ
Funk O'Matic venom's dope•ÈÀ
"@xx Alvexas xx here...lemme educate. when spidey appears in mcu movies..yup, those movies are produced by feige & co, at the MARVEL STUDIOS, owned by Disney. Disney might OWN the marvel brand..but those who actually WORK on the movies are marvel STUDIOS people...but when he is in his solo movies..they're produced by Sony, owned by Sony..however..from what we've learned..the actual production of Himecoming was actually done by feige & his ppl as well...but still under the Sony banner.so...what's ur point exactly..?•ÈÀ"
OhMyGoodnessSix I didn‰Ûªt say they did they‰Ûªre pretty much borrowing him from Sony•ÈÀ
Funk O'Matic my point being is that u said leave the live action to marvel when it‰Ûªs still technically marvel working on venom with ur logic•ÈÀ
"@xx Alvexas xx nope...i daid the sony's spidey SOLO movies with tom holland are being done by marvel ppl...UNDER Sony banner, NOT disney.now, Venom, on the other hand...still dont know if it's actually in the same spideyverse as holland's or not (n from the reviews so far...God, i hope they're NOT related).this venom thang as most of us know is all sony, namely that chick exec, AVI ARAD (the guy behind raimi's disastrous spiderman 3..yup he's even recently admitted to it)..n his partner in meddling, sonething tolmach... n feige'd explicitly said he never want avi n his partner to be around spudey, as long as it's in the mcu.•ÈÀ"
Rattamatt396 the same Sam Raimi who gave us Spider-Man 3 and didn‰Ûªt even want Venom so he didn‰Ûªt even try to get the character right because he ‰ÛÏcouldn‰Ûªt connect‰Û with his inhumanity?•ÈÀ
Just Awesome•ÈÀ

Spider Noir and Spider-Ham are also in it? Interesting. I would‰Ûªve liked to see Spider-Man 2099•ÈÀ
YEET•ÈÀ
To think that Miles Morales could not get any more sensational! (That hair just needs to go). Love that Spider-Gwen is there too.•ÈÀ
we want this trailer in to hindi plz•ÈÀ
This movie is going to be litty like a big ol titty•ÈÀ
Lovely. In one hand we have venom blockbuster and in another hand we have this animation spider man movie. Good combo if we combine this Superhero and supervillain.•ÈÀ
It will be better than mogli remake•ÈÀ

Silk and spider man 2099 arent part of spider verse?•ÈÀ
Shut up and take my money•ÈÀ
"I heard Venom movie is garbage. As expected, this looks cool tho. Focus on Spiderman animated movies•ÈÀ"
"I'm going to see this movie has Nic Cage as Spiderman noir which is perfect casting, also Spider ham and SpiderGewn•ÈÀ"
Sony here just just take all my money•ÈÀ
Spideman is overrated•ÈÀ
Finally wasted the concept of SPIDERMAN•ÈÀ
Despite the laggy animation trend...still gonna watch it cuz I love any spider-verse story. Of course Spider-Man himself lol•ÈÀ
No way!!!!•ÈÀ
I like it•ÈÀ
Is nobody gonna mention Spider-Pig? LOL•ÈÀ

"That Peter is definitely Tobey Maguire Spider-Man. There is like 3 references to him in the beginning. The iconic train scene, his kiss with MJ, and him fighting Docter Octopus.•ÈÀ"
"Toby Macguire didn't have mechanical web shooters.He also isn't the only Spider-Man to stop a train, or to have a relationship winlth MJ before Gwen.•ÈÀ"
That was excellent. Bravo Sony.•ÈÀ
Im feeling this !!!•ÈÀ
"They literally went and a made a 3d animated movie to prove that Miles Morales should've been the new spider man. Better story already, not the time tired high school student peter parker, whining about being spider man or something even worse (wanting to be an avenger gg). We got spider qwen too here. Yes it definitely has some silly angles (what even with the pig and anime girl) but we have a main villain and I saw scorpion and I believe Lizard.•ÈÀ"
OneAndOnlySound Nope. Just goes to show you know nothing about Spider-Man. And that wasn‰Ûªt the Lizard.•ÈÀ
"I said ""I believe"" like there was some kind of scorpion incarnation and something later for like a second. Also, if you don't have anything to say but ""nope you know nothing about spider man"" then move along and enjoy disney tv show level high school drama iron-spider. Wish he would've (we know he isn't or there wouldn't be a sequel being known/made) died in infinity war and been replaced by miles morales, time for something different we already had two prior spider man franchises and they had their faults too but they weren't as awful at that watered down I wanna be an avenger rushed cheap special effects homecoming stuff. Spider man comes into the MCU and that's the best thing they can think of with the amount of material they have/could've used. Michael Keaton as Vulture was the only good thing and it'd have been better if he'd had much better material to work with. The ""ackward girlfriend's father is my nemesis"" moment was just plain bad. Also as if Iron Man didn't crap all over Mandarin, shocker got the same treatment in homecoming. Made Venom from 3 look good by comparison-at least he actually was a Venom, even rushed with bad casting.•ÈÀ"
Spider-Ham and Spider-Man Noir are priceless.•ÈÀ
John Mulaney and Nicholas Cage as Spidermen. Who would've thought.•ÈÀ
"SPIDERMAN should be BLACK here comes the BLACKSPIDERMAN•ÈÀ"

Venom is one of the worst comic book movies•ÈÀ
Search the critics•ÈÀ
I heard all those reviews came from bots and Lady Gaga fans trying to sabotage the movie so A Star Is Born does better.•ÈÀ

Don't forget Tombstone at 1:55•ÈÀ
@Artificialboy003 that was Tombstone?•ÈÀ
In the background just before Scorpion attacks Miles. He can be seen at the top left corner at the back of Scorpion with a smirk and ready to fight•ÈÀ
@Artificialboy003 oh I see him.•ÈÀ
Tombstone It Looks More Like Fisk•ÈÀ
There was also a Doc Ock easter egg when Peter was narrirating about himself.•ÈÀ
@Artificialboy003 And Scorpion looks like a scorpion.•ÈÀ

Traveling Boi What Are You Trying To Say•ÈÀ
"Can someone please make a gif of   Spidey's Christmas album•ÈÀ"
I love it but I FUCKING HATE ANIME I HOPE IT DIES AHHH!•ÈÀ
@MrFoxyMan But it's not an anime(assuming you mean Japanese anime). You meant to say that you hate animated films in general?•ÈÀ
Yeah I probably should have said I HATE Japanese anime and I ment the anime spidey character•ÈÀ
Pizza time•ÈÀ
"Black Panther reference at the end of the trailer, I see you!•ÈÀ"
Do I have to say it? This looks way better than any live action Spiderman movie that Sony has done.•ÈÀ
"How does this all fits to, ""I don't feel so good..""•ÈÀ"
This looks brilliant!•ÈÀ
Wreck it Ralph: Marvel Edition•ÈÀ
Please. Please explain to me how this is in ANY way related to Wreck It Ralph. I'll wait.•ÈÀ
When Spider-Ham appearing is nice thing you can say about trailer not very good.  Animation looks very weird and really bad at times.  I get a trailer but as impressions not give good ones.  Maybe I will catch this on dvd but I'm not really interested at the moment in seeing it.•ÈÀ
Ok man your loss•ÈÀ
The fact that Aquaman and Bumblebee comes out the week later when I would go see it doesn't help either.•ÈÀ
that looks amazing•ÈÀ
IMAGINE A CAMEEO OF STAN LEE IN HERE .... LOOOLL•ÈÀ

Thank you SONY _Ù÷Ä_Ù÷Ä_Ù÷Ä•ÈÀ

I simply LOVE how Gwen Stacy scenes are portrayed with the same coloring of her personal comic series <3•ÈÀ
Yea the art style in her comics were gr8•ÈÀ
LETS GOOO!•ÈÀ
Nothing but liberal ideas. Maga•ÈÀ
it's actually part of the story it seems good i like the art•ÈÀ

Yeah!•ÈÀ
Now it makes sense after the Spider-Man ps4 game.•ÈÀ
Eshaan Sharma Nope. It makes sense if you‰Ûªre an actual fan of Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
Who hear already beat the spiderman ps4 game?•ÈÀ
What the eff is this•ÈÀ

Then learn English•ÈÀ
Knock /Da Deathstroke Lol if I was him I ain't gonna learn another language to watch a movie•ÈÀ
@White-Van Helsing Not for a movie tho. For whole modern world it's basically is one of the most important skills. It's shamefull nowadays not to know at least basic english for a grown person :/•ÈÀ

JÌ_dÌ_s I like it. Plus it makes sense. You wouldn't want to have too much hair if you're wearing a mask all the time. Gets hot and uncomfortable and it would bunch up in the back and look weird.•ÈÀ

Peter Porker!•ÈÀ
"They should do a live action spiderman multiverse film with Tom Holland Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, I would love to see them three as their respective spidermans meet!•ÈÀ"
Looks like the spider that bit Peter Parker went out to have a large family of her own.... just saying•ÈÀ
They keep changing her name may as well call her Dyke cut spider•ÈÀ
Awesome story line•ÈÀ

Spider ham!•ÈÀ
Finally a movie  with a fat superhero in it! Oink!•ÈÀ
"What about black batman?  His father was a big time drug kingpin and then went to jail.  But the money was hidden in his safe house.  Alfred is the butler from fresh prince of bel air.•ÈÀ"

Fresh is the only word I can try to sum this up.well done team•ÈÀ
THE POPCICLE OMG IM DIEING•ÈÀ
"Cool! But can there be any less frames? It still feels like stop motion animation, not a comic book.•ÈÀ"

I wonder if spiderman 2099 is going to be in this movie•ÈÀ
Someone tell Sony to do Games and Animation from now on and let the Live action rights go back to Marvel•ÈÀ
No Disney intervension? _ÙÔ•ÈÀ

Watched this like fifty times already and I‰Ûªm at school right now•ÈÀ
Amazing•ÈÀ
So anybody else hear some of the Free Bird guitar riffs in the back?•ÈÀ
My heart can‰Ûªt handle all this spider. I love these characters so much and to see them all in the same movie is incredible•ÈÀ
I like how they added tobeys trilogy•ÈÀ
Nah I‰Ûªm not buying it how do you land on your toes perfectly without breaking them coming straight from the sky at 1:26 the physics for this movie ain‰Ûªt adding up..._Ù÷_•ÈÀ
Well spider-men can bench press a bus easily so landing like that is a piece of cake for them•ÈÀ
This remind me of an episode from ultimate Spiderman•ÈÀ
This is too perfect•ÈÀ
Amazing wow•ÈÀ
1:39 Spider-Man PS4 Insomniac Advanced Suit!!!!!_Ù¥á_Ù¥ü•ÈÀ
Its the year of the spider•ÈÀ

"not really alot of schools have uniforms its actually common, alot of boarding schools too•ÈÀ"
Who's  hyped for spidy (edit) spidys•ÈÀ
This was leaked out way before via an episode from ultimate Spiderman and there are many green goblins too•ÈÀ
So spider man is black? Black people can‰Ûªt afford movie tickets! why even bother?•ÈÀ
"1:36 *w* hello~ *it was that moment I knew, I fell in love*•ÈÀ"

That's a pig actually. Spider-Ham.•ÈÀ
"Visuals and story seem awesome, but I'm a little iffy on the voice acting. Miles and his dad sound good, but the rest feel a little off to me. Still, cant wait!•ÈÀ"
So anyone gonna talk about how the whole movie was basically spoiled unless they have some huge plot twist•ÈÀ
This looks so freakin' good!•ÈÀ
This must be epic•ÈÀ
CJ is a cop lol•ÈÀ

@Pulse 00 it's different dimensions not time travel•ÈÀ
The First Ever Black Person 2099 is a different dimension... one where Miguel O‰ÛªHara became Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
@The First Ever Black Person may be it is 2099 according to the other dimension calendars lol_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
spider pig. from the simpsons movie _Ù÷ •ÈÀ
@kitches Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
@The First Ever Black Person actually spiderman 2099 is from earth 928•ÈÀ
"@kitches in the original comics, he's called Spider-Ham.•ÈÀ"
The First Ever Black Person but noir is there•ÈÀ
Yaaaaas•ÈÀ
did they have to ruin gwen stacy‰Ûªs look?•ÈÀ
I like her haircut looks more attractive•ÈÀ
Web Head cool?•ÈÀ
"How did they ruin Gwen Stacey's look exactly? Spider-Gwen has always been written as a rock musician/drummer. This haircut looks exactly like something a rock artist would have. Sorry it ruins your little jerk off fantasies where she has hair from the 1960s, but it's more than fitting.•ÈÀ"
@Kum quat yeah•ÈÀ
Shoof no need to rub in that you prefer an overused hairstyle.•ÈÀ
"""Double tap to release.""... I always wondered about that.•ÈÀ"
Not my Spider-Man Peter Parker is the only true Spider-Man•ÈÀ
at this moment deadpool knew he fucked up•ÈÀ
@brandicoot agreed with you there. Deadpool fucked up.•ÈÀ
That's funny because there are at least a dozen Peter Parkers. Miles is a good Spidey anyways. Why do you care so much that Pete isn't the main protagonist?•ÈÀ
"You do know your ""true"" Spider-Man is in the movie as well, right? Someone's playing dumb.•ÈÀ"
Isaac because I truly like miles as a spider man but I just think Peter is the only true spider man if that makes any sense•ÈÀ
Inugami X9 yea I do•ÈÀ
"@Deadpool well he's the original, but the others aren't fake Spideys, so I'm not seeing how he's the only true one.•ÈÀ"
Deadpool Peter gave Miles his blessings to be Spider-Man. Miles is Peter approved.•ÈÀ
CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS!!!•ÈÀ
I'll see it when jt comes out on DVD the trailer didn't sell  me why I need to see it as it looks ok in some shots but others it looks not  that good•ÈÀ
Wtf is this Peter from Raimi trilogy•ÈÀ

Subline that isn‰Ûªt a black panther reference. It‰Ûªs a lion not panther.•ÈÀ
"@Steven RodriguezYes, you are correct.•ÈÀ"
"@Jello PuddingI put it at that time because that's when Kingpin starts talking.•ÈÀ"
Peter also actually double taps on his web shooters. So it's not necessarily a video reference•ÈÀ

1:37   Who is she?•ÈÀ
toikouya Peni parker•ÈÀ
Spiderman in all shapes and sizes!•ÈÀ
what's with the low FPS?•ÈÀ
It's an artistic choice to both give the movie a stop motion style and a comic book style (signifying the changing of the panels).•ÈÀ
@Brendan Milburn also hurts eyes and causes visual discomfort•ÈÀ
"@Knock /Da Deathstroke I honestly don't know what you're talking about, I don't feel any discomfort/pain watching this.•ÈÀ"
I WANT THIS MOVIE TO GET A SEQUEL!•ÈÀ
This animation style is refreshing•ÈÀ

Ahh I wanted to see 2099 Spider-Man•ÈÀ
Me too ;-;•ÈÀ
And me to•ÈÀ
The Mysterious Red Warrior: Blood maybe he‰Ûªll get a quick cameo in the final battle when the collider most likely goes out of control.•ÈÀ
Me too dude•ÈÀ
The Mysterious Red Warrior: Blood me too i was waiting for his reveal i think i saw his suit in one of the cases but i can‰Ûªt tell•ÈÀ
That's too edgy for the tone this film is clearly going for.•ÈÀ
"@SuperUnunquadium Dude they literally have Spiderman NOIR, the darkest of all Spiderman characters.•ÈÀ"
I don't remember but do we know who's voicing him?•ÈÀ
@Zonny C Nick Cage.•ÈÀ
unchartedgoldenabyss that‰Ûªs for Noir•ÈÀ
@Zonny C Shamiek Moore voices Miles and Jake Johnson voices Parker•ÈÀ
"Spitfire Studios I know, I was asking who the voice actor for Spiderman 2099 was•ÈÀ"
"@Zonny C Dan Gilvezan in Shattered Dimensions, Christopher Daniel Barnes in Edge of time, and Freddy Rodriguez in Ultimate Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
This is supposed to be a movie series so you'll eventually see him•ÈÀ
What about spider punk•ÈÀ
@SuperUnunquadium they had him in a kids cartoon•ÈÀ
Now there's only two characters left that people wanna see (well I wanna see) Venom (everyone and specifically agent venom) and Spiderman 2099•ÈÀ

This movie looks so fckn awesome!•ÈÀ
Sweet looking animation - by far some of the best I‰Ûªve seen•ÈÀ
They should have saved the multiverse story for the sequel. Its too much for a first movie.•ÈÀ
Eh not feeling it•ÈÀ
The sam raimi references bring back so many memorys•ÈÀ
"So Peter Parker is a homeless drunk person now? Geez, the years have not been kind.•ÈÀ"
perffffffffect•ÈÀ
"The point of Spider-man was responsibility, not difference. I'm not exactly sure why hollywood feels the need to appeal to LGBT on every front. Cute trailer, though. Might watch it.•ÈÀ"
Frog Redstar maybe you should pick up a comic book•ÈÀ
Where's 2099?•ÈÀ
I interesting in this movie•ÈÀ
The art style in this movie looks completely awful. The foregrounds look like blurry watercolors vomited on top of a 50's 3d movie. I hate everything about this.•ÈÀ
Song name!!!•ÈÀ
I wish Insomniac would some kind of  multiplayer to Spider-Man. Would be awesome to have Miles and Gwen Spideys playing with you. Swinging around the City!•ÈÀ
1:41 YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSSS•ÈÀ

"Oh mann! I am seeing this movie!! Hopes are way up this time around _ÙÕø_ÙÕø_ÙÕø•ÈÀ"
If Spider Man Ps4 is not in this movie than is already a failure•ÈÀ
"Are they implying that this is Tobey Maguire's Spider-man? That'd be pretty cool, to he honest!•ÈÀ"
"I think it's just a homage like in the Lego Batman movie, where they showed all the different Batman movies.•ÈÀ"
"It actually would have been cool if this spider- man would have been voiced by Toby as a sort of meta joke. Though, if this Spider-Man was from the movies, that means he got the bad ending.•ÈÀ"
"Muerto but that was....Lego. Lol. Jk. I do get your point! Still, would have been cool.•ÈÀ"
"elchito3 Well...he would have cost a lot more, for starters. Also, I get the point about a bad ending. Maybe yeah. I wouldn't want them to ruin Nolan's ending as well. So, I understand preserving that ending as well.•ÈÀ"
m down w that...just...LESS crying please.•ÈÀ
karan singal pretty much. The train scene is from Spider-Man 2•ÈÀ
"@karan singal but nolan's ending was ALREADY ruined..by...HIMSELF.nolan fucked up his awesome dark knight films with RISES. yeah..the whole third DK movie is atrocious... such a shame...•ÈÀ"
Dont care what anyone says. Im gona stick with him being toby.•ÈÀ
karan singal it wouldn‰Ûªt have cost a lot more I don‰Ûªt think. When‰Ûªs the last high pro file gig you‰Ûªve seen Tobey in? I forget the guys name but he was in New girl and several large scale movies while I haven‰Ûªt seen tobey since... idk cameo in Tropic Thunder?•ÈÀ
"No is not, is just a reference•ÈÀ"
No it isnt he has mechanical webshooters•ÈÀ
karan singal Tobey Maguire is not the only Spider-Man that has stopped a train before.•ÈÀ
No. He has mechanial web shooters•ÈÀ
Levi Pittman he voiced the older version of the man character in Boss Baby which is fairly recent and also a 3D film.•ÈÀ
"@Princess Wolfy It's not that genius, is the way some of those play out.•ÈÀ"
It's just a reference cuz saying that is say ps4 spiderman is Tobey which he's not•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm pretty sure it‰Ûªs the same storyline as Spider-Man ps4 I‰Ûªm probably wrong though•ÈÀ
"take notes spiderman homecoming, this is how to not be garbage.•ÈÀ"

Why is Peter such a douche?•ÈÀ
"hes not a douche this is his actually personality.not that tom Holland isn't an amazing Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
hes an adult already•ÈÀ
D.DoT-Z hes grown man so ...I mean•ÈÀ
"Cynical with age.The movie has an older Peter Parker, at this point being a superhero is like an office job to him.Who else casually sucker punches a car back through a window?•ÈÀ"
when spidey is a teen hes more funny and never shuts up. as he grows he keeps his humor but becomes less patient and yes a douche.•ÈÀ

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! I WANT TO SEE IT NOW!!!!!!•ÈÀ
Okay I want to watch this but I know next to nothing about the Spiderverse (except the original Spiderman movie trilogy)•ÈÀ

@Beef Bronson dumb•ÈÀ
That was so good.... btw gwen stacy is hotter in this than the real one•ÈÀ
Just one ward for this movie *Zabardast*_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷•ÈÀ
Spider-man noir cant stick to walls•ÈÀ
So this movie is have a concept parallel universe? Miles universe doesn't have spiderman?  And then something happen and blow up and open a portal for connected from the other universe to Miles universe?•ÈÀ
Aerob Are you unsure of Miles‰Ûª history? He is the Spider-Man of his universe.•ÈÀ
"@Fearless 4 Him but if you see the official teaser, Miles go to funeral,  and there is writen P P and I think that is Peter Parker,  and I'm sure Peter Parker on Miles universe is already dead, that's the reason when Peter from other dimention show up on front of Miles he said ""Impossible""•ÈÀ"
"Aerob Yes, that‰Ûªs correct. Miles Morales is from the Ultimate universe. Miles only becomes a hero after Peter Parker was beaten and killed by the Sinister Six. His death inspired Miles to take up the mantle of Spider-Man. Peter Parker also died in Gwen Stacy‰Ûªs universe.•ÈÀ"
@Fearless 4 Him wow thank you for your information•ÈÀ
"""It's beginning to look a lot like a non-denominational holiday""•ÈÀ"

Can Potentially be the best Spider-Man movie ever.•ÈÀ
Best spiderman movie•ÈÀ
Spiderman wants you to like my comment...•ÈÀ
Guess the multiverse is the best way for SJWs to bastardize established characters as much as they want. ^^•ÈÀ
Faf-kun read a comic man. Miles has been around for 7 years now. Spider Gwen and Peni Parker has been around for 4 years. Spider ham has been around for 35 years. Spider man noir has been around for 9 years. I mean would you prefer for marvel to make Peter Parker into a black-female-vegan-noir-pig or just make new characters that can stand alongside Peter Parker. I really don‰Ûªt see how this is a bastardization of his character.•ÈÀ
im curious...who (besides kids) are gonna waste their money on this movie?•ÈÀ
Spider-Man fans (looks to be the best Spider-Man made) and animation fans (this animation is gorgeous and unique).•ÈÀ
It will be so good if they make Toby make a voiceover for Peter Parker and spider man or at least Andrew•ÈÀ
SICC•ÈÀ
Gwens hair.... X.x why•ÈÀ
WTF did I just saw??? Seriously SONY•ÈÀ
Omgomgomgomg I WAIT THIS too muts•ÈÀ

Nice framerate.•ÈÀ

But where is Ben Reilly?•ÈÀ
0:15 has a reference to Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions•ÈÀ
Luis Burciaga is it the tablet of order and chaos?•ÈÀ
Luis Burciaga 0:10 is great reference also! Only people who watched the old spider-man will understand•ÈÀ
Or it‰Ûªs just like comic books•ÈÀ
So cool they did Raimi references•ÈÀ

@92brunod big•ÈÀ
"Since he don't know gwen stacey, I think this is the multiverse version of Sam raimi's trilogy. Why they introducing multiverse in the first movie then?•ÈÀ"
"@Joshua AndreaHe has mechanial web shooters, so it isn't Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"
"Sam Raimi's Spider-Man isn't the only version to stop a train, kiss MJ and not know who gwen is.Insomniac's Spider-Man is the most recent example•ÈÀ"
"@LeanGreenMeme no it's clearly not, it's just an Easter egg from those movies.•ÈÀ"
I bet no one saw the advanced suit from the PS4 game in this trailer!•ÈÀ

I think Gwen wanted to be the only girl among all the guys lol•ÈÀ
Silk got power that pretty much entice all male spider-man to mate with her though so I don't think it's wise to put her close to those many spider-men•ÈÀ

"Yes, it's intentional. They wanted the animation to both have a stop motion style and comic book style (including having an effect that represents the panels changing).•ÈÀ"
"Interesting...ok, thanks.•ÈÀ"
This gonna be owesome_Ù÷Ä•ÈÀ

"It does kind of look like that for this movie too, but based off this trailer, Kingpin (?) is the central villain.•ÈÀ"
"yeah, i'm really looking forward to seeing this one. it looks very promising, but as i said, i really hope there won't be much that still has to come in terms of contents. i would rather have a clear storyline than some mumble-jumble clusterfuck of villains and plotlines, though i don't think it's gonna be like that, which is obviously perfect•ÈÀ"

Peni Parker? I know everyone else but is she new or something?•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker isn't super new, she was introduced in the original Spider-Verse. But she didn't get as much attention as Gwen or Noir, she was just a throwback to anime influences.Kind of cool that they're introducing her here too.The Spider-Verse saga might not have been great, but it introduced a lot of really cool ideas.•ÈÀ"
"@ThatKidSavage_11 relatively new, she was in the spider verse thing in the comics last year•ÈÀ"

Not changed for literally zero reasons.Then I tried to meet in the middle and say we'll there's a black spider man, and female, however they are there own characters with there own development which allows them to be great characters and leaves the original alone.Then the dude was like ""oooooooohh so it's good as long as there segregated?""I'm like how they connect the verses all the time?And here we are.

"2:27 WTF WAKANDA?0:07 also Are these references to Wakanda•ÈÀ"
Love the ending scene•ÈÀ
I'm so overexcited i thought that last scene was Wakanda _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
The frame rate is too bad•ÈÀ
this actually looks good. only thing i don't like is the stop motion effects. why couldn't they just make it regular 3d animation? why add those dizzying stop motion effects. its looks weird.•ÈÀ
At least release the fcking song•ÈÀ
"I'm throwing money at my screen but nothing's happening!_Ù_á_Ù_‰Û‰ªâ•ü•ÈÀ"
you what?•ÈÀ
"Amen!  I loved spiderman, but was always like, you know, he's just too WHITE!  If only he could be more black-mexicanish, naw mean?•ÈÀ"
Do people really enjoy putting gender symbols in comments?•ÈÀ
Why would you throw money at this animatic catastrophe?!•ÈÀ
DumbDuck44 cause Spider-Man is white miles is black so stfu•ÈÀ

Keep doing it•ÈÀ
You are Loony AF if you think this isn't going to Smash•ÈÀ
@Levi Mixon not too familiar with the spiderverse I see•ÈÀ
"Y'all just had your own black-power Wakanda action going on (not to be confused with the technologically advanced real world Uganda); why you gotta culturally appropriate our spider man heroes?   Bad enough they already made Heimdall (in Nordic lore described as ""the whitest of the Gods"", not even joking) a black guy.    What's next, are we going to have Oprah cast as George Washington?•ÈÀ"
"@DumbDuck44 Race doesn't matter, a character is not defined by his ethnicity•ÈÀ"
"Psycho Joe I am familiar actually, I was just pointing out the atrocious art style they are using for this movie. It's choppy and looks like garbage to me•ÈÀ"
"If it doesn't matter, then why do we have to replace spider man with a kid that looks like a used q-tip?   Make a new different superhero, and stop taking our heroes.     Or tell you what, how about we make Blackpanther be a freckled red headed guy, and Wakanda is a village in Poland.•ÈÀ"
Well you shouldn't be watching porn in the first place•ÈÀ
Try spinning that's a good trick!•ÈÀ
Lit•ÈÀ
This meme will never get old.•ÈÀ

@DumbDuck44 well Miles has been here for 8 years now•ÈÀ
Levi Mixon because we do whatever we want. Stfu•ÈÀ

Holy jesus its nicholas cage•ÈÀ
"Why does the animation look so jerky? You paid to build these beautiful 3d models and world, just render it at a normal frame rate! (or whatever it would take to fix this issue)•ÈÀ"
It looks like they are incoperating elements of stop motion into it which makes sense this movie seems to be utilizing a bunch of animation styles.•ÈÀ
Id say that now majority of people have finished spiderman ps4 is why the trailer is coming out now. You gotta consider how well Sony is with their timing.•ÈÀ
Where is Spider-Cop??!•ÈÀ
The BGM is awesome. Anybody knw tht song?•ÈÀ

"My reaction to the first trailer: AMAZING! SPECTACULAR!My reaction to the second trailer:What the heck•ÈÀ"
No idea if this means anything but does Spider-man normally train with a VCR/DVD player thing? He's using it to learn how to web swing here but in Civil War when we first meet him he has one in his hands when he meets Tony.•ÈÀ

So peter Parker in this is essentially Toby McGuire‰Ûªs Spider-Man•ÈÀ
Fucking Nick Cage as Spider-Man Noir. Definitely seeing this film.•ÈÀ
Why the framerate is like 14 or sth•ÈÀ
"no. I can not believe it, it is a wonderful trailer, I love the idea that they are going to join the spiderman in a team like in the comics, and I love it. they are great. It is seen that it will be a very tender film and I do not know why but I have the impression that I will get some tears, if they are happy, emotional or sad, it does not matter. This is my number one movie in December.•ÈÀ"
"They should've had Toby Maguire voice Peter Parker, and had Emma Stone voice Gwen Stacy.•ÈÀ"

"Theres a ton of spider people in the currect comics continuity, Peter and Miles are alive at the same time(both are spiderman), there's also Spider Woman, etc etc.Miles first appearance was in 2011 when he became Spiderman after Peter gets killed by the Green goblin.

"People online who are ""anti-SJW"" freak out more than ""SJWs"" do when a superhero is made to be a POC. It's also not like they just made this character up now as a diversity plea; as [P]oX said, there has been a black spiderman since 2011. 7 years. Get over yourself.•ÈÀ"
Pause 1:39 spiderman ps4 suit (near aunt may)•ÈÀ

I mean that Peter might not have know gwen Stacy or he might have and they just didn't show it.•ÈÀ
Lordgir25 1 but this is a more experienced spideman not the early days version though...•ÈÀ

@charles giosano lol okay i mean miles was created back in 2011 but let's go with him being a product of pc culture.•ÈÀ
"+Lordgir25 1 Yeah man , he and Duke Thomas(Bat family) are in all likelihood are products of PC culture or for appealing to the black masses ...Good characters though !!!•ÈÀ"
Miles should‰Ûªve stuck to the comics. Imo.•ÈÀ
Nope•ÈÀ
Now the symbiote can't fuse with him cuz he is already black•ÈÀ

Why didn't you like it•ÈÀ
"@banana retardada The art direction just didn't click for me. The style felt a bit off and the animation left too much to be desired. Also I can't get the image of Nick Miller, out of my head, when I hear Jake Johnson speak. It just wasn't for me, you know?•ÈÀ"
"@Linnea ÌĞstergren I do know but I disagree with the animation,looks awesome to me•ÈÀ"
Sooo amped!!!•ÈÀ

Looks dumb.•ÈÀ
What if symbiote fuses with him... Will he be black squared Spiderman?•ÈÀ
"Thanks for checking the comment... Get your mind blown...What if this movie is an alternate reality and that the symbiote had fused with the sperm of the Spiderman's white grandfather while having sex and so the Spiderman and his dad is black•ÈÀ"
bluej o5 okay now you‰Ûªre getting trippy put the pipe down•ÈÀ

How in the hell is Miles being trained to be spiderman by Peter and they're from 2 different universe....this trailer got Miles looking like he the only spiderman that needs help on mastering his powers which is DOG WHISTLING!!!•ÈÀ
I mean we don't really have that much of time frame to go off of rn for the movie. For all we know miles might still be new to being spidy or maybe just asked for tips.•ÈÀ
oh god its so fking choppy. The framerate is horrible•ÈÀ
A black Mexican Spiderman? If only he was non binary and vegan.•ÈÀ

How do you know they are crap?•ÈÀ

"Spider man is black???  Does that mean Luke cage, blade, falcon, cyborg and shaft are white...? Come on world quit trying to please people by making such trash.•ÈÀ"
Your pretty late buddy miles has been a main stay spider for awhile now dude. Also he's actually a pretty cool character to follow I mean we've  been following Peter for forever why not show the other spidys some love?•ÈÀ
"Jason R Hey buddy,you blow in from stupid town?•ÈÀ"
It's not a matter of showing other spider men love?  It's a matter of what Spider-Man is... Peter Parker.  Again we even have black panther???  The only reason this Spider-Man exists is cause people cry racist at the sight of a white super hero and if not enough color is involved in such spotlight it's a problem... when really the big problem is recreations like this.  Should we start making things that were black culture white?  People can hate my comment I really don't care. I'm not racist I have a good mix of friends by my side and we all think this movement going on in the world is nothing more than a waste of everyone's time.  Maybe roots would be a better film if it was white or maybe even Tyler Perry films... lol seriously people.  Are you all really that blind?•ÈÀ
"@Jason R lmao but Peter is here and your still complaining. Also a characters quality shouldn't be judged based off the color of the skin they have but their actually story and background. Needless to say miles is very well done intereation of spider man. Also he was created in 2011 way before pandering towards sjw groups really started to take hold. I'm not saying that diverserity for the sake of diversity is good, but miles is definitely a worth while character is pretty deserving of having his own movie.•ÈÀ"
"Lordgir25 1 I never said miles was never deserving of anything...  I can give you one reason why this is a cartoon.  If it flops they only cancel artists and voices with no concern of character contracts.  I will say this again my view is this story is stupid spiderman has been what he is for 56 years... you can like it, you can even love it. Most people appreciate original some like new school but everyone can dislike something that gets butchered... so much so the names are different the story is different... why even call him spider man??? If you don't understand that's fine just don't be surprised when someone makes a comment about this trash.•ÈÀ"
@Jason R whatever man that's  your hang up all ik is the movie looks dope.•ÈÀ
1:04 wtf is with these prices?•ÈÀ
hoo boi im so excited ajsjkwkak•ÈÀ
I like the music•ÈÀ
Is that a loli spidergirl?! MMMMMMM MUST LEWD HER•ÈÀ
This movie is gonna be really bad. I had high hopes for this and I really thought it was gonna be good until this trailer. You can't have all these Spider-People be such an integral part of this story. They should stay as small references. Trying to get each Spider-Person back to their respective universe is a really lame plot. It should be about Miles Morales and maybe a little guidance from Peter Parker. Come on Sony don't screw everything up. Hopefully Venom will still be good...•ÈÀ
"So Spider Man was black all along? 0:49 he says ""I thought i was the one and only Spider Man?""•ÈÀ"
In his dimension. Did you not watch the rest of the trailer?•ÈÀ
Taytyaaytyat Yes i did•ÈÀ

Miles accidentally gets his new, super-sticky hands stuck to Gwen's head, and they end up having to cut her hair to separate them.

"Yeah the original Spider-Man has to be a hobo ""why"" because he's white? And the next Spider-Man has to Miles because he's black but he's half latino but never mattered even in the comics. And let's not forget Gwen Stacy who sounds like she's gonna have an attitude for no reason and be better then the boys because she's a wamen and having the Antifa haircut cause you know the Director is Pro Antifa(Classified Terrorist Group). All in this one trailer this is the vibe I'm getting and for ""Me"" I'm not interested at all for seeing this.•ÈÀ"

HOW MUCH WORSE ARE U GUYZ GONNA MAKE FUN OF SPIDER MAN?•ÈÀ
If we were at a time when superheroes werent all about bad comedy...i would have given this movie a chance. But lately (especially with Spider-Man) its all been terrible comedy. I want a serious story. Not something extremely dark. Just a well written story that doesnt have a joke every 5 minutes. The new Spider-Man game for PS4 managed to deliver a good balance. A shame that the same cannot be done in a cartoon version. Plus...the animation here looks bad and really doesnt impress me.•ÈÀ
You do realise that Spiderman has always been a jokester and making a dark situation into a joke. Thats literally always been Peter Parker's spiderman. Majority of the Spidermen have been jokesters say for a select few who were always serious.•ÈÀ

"He already got a cameo in the game, why not!•ÈÀ"
Manas Nair duh it's a marvel movie•ÈÀ
Don‰Ûªt say that•ÈÀ
"Seeing as how he's the creator of spiderman, he better be•ÈÀ"
He's cameod in animated movies before (Big Hero 6 and Teen Titans Go! To The Movies) so I don't see why he wouldn't.•ÈÀ
"Oh definitelyHe got one in PS4 game.& That was awesome cameo•ÈÀ"
Imagine Stan Lee being a Spiderman in this movie•ÈÀ
Anyone else want SPIDER-STAN?•ÈÀ
"If They managed to put a cameo of Stan Lee in the video game, i'm sure they will also be able to do it in that movie too•ÈÀ"
"Manas Nair I think so, no one expected him to appear in the spidey game _Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
Imagine if he doesn't have a cameo in this movie. Would be shocking•ÈÀ
2:00•ÈÀ
The people who saw the 35 minute preview at Comic-Con said there is one•ÈÀ
Sony you're brilliant for this one.....cant wait to see my boys miles & peter porker....•ÈÀ
why is spider man African american again?•ÈÀ
There are multipleeee infinite dimensions with diff stories . There's a girl with spider powers. There's a freakin pig with spider powers. Why is miles such a suprise•ÈÀ
who's the japanese girl ?•ÈÀ
Peni Parker•ÈÀ
Also it seems they‰Ûªre not doing the inheritors storyline which I WILL KILL THEM FOR but we get to see all the spider people so that‰Ûªs settled I guess we better get a morlun post credits scene tho•ÈÀ
Y‰Ûªall think 2099 gonna be in this?•ÈÀ
Didnt see him it's a cool suit but I'm not a big fan of that spiderman.•ÈÀ
I hope so•ÈÀ
Mario Barbaro cool?•ÈÀ

BC Animated movie hai ... I thought original one•ÈÀ
Spiderman‰Ûªs black welp my child hood just got ruined•ÈÀ

Is this out in cinemas ?•ÈÀ
Wish this type of animation was used in the video game. This would be so much betterrrrr•ÈÀ
Is it stop motion animation?•ÈÀ
I was originally disinterested in the movie but after seeing this trailer... I think im gonna see it! :D•ÈÀ
Cool...•ÈÀ
I have a spiderverse collectors edition with me ima drag my friend and my comic and whenever something from the comic happend ima hit him and say TOLD YOU SO•ÈÀ

Yo dawg is Nick cage voicing spider-man noir?•ÈÀ
"so... no spiderman 2099? k. still gonna watch this. glad that spiderman noire included in this movie.•ÈÀ"
"Khairul Ikhwan he may be there, just not as a main focus character. Or he could be in the sequel•ÈÀ"
You guys think Silk will be in this movie?•ÈÀ
@James Dai nah.•ÈÀ
"_ÙÓ« Already watched ""SPIDER MAN: INTO THE SPIDER VERSE"" Movie t.co/3Hodi5yZnU Unglaublicher film! Sehr zu empfehlen, es auszuprobieren!•ÈÀ"
"There is still a chance Spider-Man 2099 will appear. In the previous trailer there is a scene where Miles looks closely to a spider which shape shifts to other spiders in different frames. In one of them there is one particular spider with a tag ""Alchemax"" on its side. That may be a slight confirmation for Miguel O'Hara•ÈÀ"
even when you found out the ghost rider is voicing him•ÈÀ
Man Pete. You let yourself go lol.•ÈÀ

"I remember after seeing the first trailer that in my head canon, Peter Parker in this movie is an older version of Sami Raimi/Tobey McGuire Spiderman. So I was happy to see the references to that trilogy from 0:10•ÈÀ"
"Me too, my geeky side was tingling.•ÈÀ"
"Eh I think it's just a reference, in the swinging scene he mentions tap twice to send out the web implying it's a device instead of organic webbing•ÈÀ"
"trylobyte07 this spiday got nothing to do with the original trilogy, its more of a comic book universe•ÈÀ"
I wish Tobey voiced him. Not really feeling the guy currently doing it.•ÈÀ
"@Peter Parker lol there's 3 references to the Raimi films : stopping the train with the Christ metaphor, the kiss with MJ, and the car being thrown inside the restaurant (but this time, it aint Peter Parker, it's Spider-Man with all his powers and he stop the car lmao)•ÈÀ"
"StÌ©phane Wawrzyniak referenced doesnt mean its from the same universe, spider man ps4 referenced from all the movies•ÈÀ"
"qwertyuiop123456168 bruh tobey‰Ûªs voice suck, did you hear him voicing the video games spiderman?•ÈÀ"
"Icarus Yeah. Like I said, it is my 'head canon' But I love the references•ÈÀ"
Ho hooo•ÈÀ
Good Artistic Quality_ÙÔ. But What Happen to Animation_Ù_Ó. It looks like 5fps. 19's Animations are Better than This.•ÈÀ
It's a good year for Spider Man.•ÈÀ
At 1:37 what kind of spider Man was that!?!?!•ÈÀ
Dragon Sniper noir•ÈÀ

"Do animals talk in this dimension, cause i don't wanna freak him out _Ù÷âhe actually freaks out !!!•ÈÀ"
I'll love to see a Devil May Cry series or movie with this animation.•ÈÀ
The Dark Knight said the son of sparda himself•ÈÀ
Absolutely not. Totally different vibe than something like spiderman. A movie with DMC4 graphics would be amazing though.•ÈÀ
@[Beacon Autem Dolor]: Have you seen the Devil May Cry 4 in pachinko that animation is something out DreamWorks or this.•ÈÀ
The Dark Knight the pachinko cutscenes actually are on par if not better than the actual game cutscenes were.•ÈÀ
That reminds me of Viewtiful Joe•ÈÀ
This looks awesome•ÈÀ
"1:53, eggman reincarnated.•ÈÀ"

Cool glad to help a bit•ÈÀ
Best Spiderman ever•ÈÀ
Where's the Indian Spiderman? Pavitr Prabhakar•ÈÀ
"How awesome it would be if Tobey Maguire's,  Andrew Garfield's and Tom Holland's version of Spiderman is in the movie too!? _Ù÷Û•ÈÀ"
make the Real movie....•ÈÀ
When an animated movie looks better than homecoming...No shade tho Tom Holland is good. His solo movie was mediocre though.•ÈÀ
"If this movie loses the Oscar to Incredibles 2, it will be confirmed that the Oscars is broken and corrupted.•ÈÀ"
Incredibles 2 was an awesome movie though. And this one hasn't even come out yet (though I'm almost too hyped for it). It is a little premature to be calling it oscar worthy though.•ÈÀ
"It's a good film but it lacks the depth of the first film. Into the Spider-verse has a very unique animation style and if the substance equals that, then it will easily surpass Incredibles 2.•ÈÀ"
The people that choose the Oscars don't watch animation so if it's not Pixar or Disney it literately does not exist to them.•ÈÀ
I refuse to take the oscars seriously after they nominated Boss Baby and Ferdinand instead of Lego Batman and Captain Underpants•ÈÀ
"Mark Fitzgerald I personally want Isle of Dogs to win at the Oscars!•ÈÀ"
Incredibles 2 wasn't that great tbh•ÈÀ
Mark Fitzgerald this movie hasn‰Ûªt even come out yet calm down??•ÈÀ
Bro this movie isn't even released yet. Calm dowm.•ÈÀ
"It won't. It'll lose to ""Teen Titans GO! To The Movies"".•ÈÀ"
You can't be serious dude. Incredibles 2 was a perfectly made animation with an amazing story and even better characters. This is made by Sony who haven't released a good movie in a while now so don't be so sure•ÈÀ
"If animation style was enough to equal Oscar winner, Laika would have already won the awards each year they released a movie.•ÈÀ"
Animated sequels dont ever win awards. Toy Story3 only won cause the category didn't exist in 1999.•ÈÀ
@Dan Gillen probably because Disney and Pixar make the best animated films..•ÈÀ
I will like Isle of Dogs to win•ÈÀ

LETS FUCKING GO•ÈÀ
Sooooo this Peter Parker is Toby McGuire Spider-Man? Or am I just thinking too much?•ÈÀ
Nathan Sese well maybe he references a lot from Toby Spider-Man•ÈÀ
You're thinking too much. It's just some references•ÈÀ
He uses web shooters in this so sadly hes not tobey•ÈÀ
Nathan Sese he most likly main universe peter Parker aka 616•ÈÀ
"After seeing Miles in the Spider-Man game, I kind of like that version better•ÈÀ"
"If this movie lives up to these trailers, then that will cement Lord and Miller as my favorite directors.•ÈÀ"
John Mulaney was in this trailer for like 5 seconds and he's already won my heart as spider-ham honestly•ÈÀ
1:39 they have the ps4 spiderman suit_Ù÷•ÈÀ
Who's gonna see this movie? What will be your expectations?•ÈÀ
"Am I crazy or does the animation seem a little choppy? Like I even noticed this when I saw one of the trailers in a theater, and I thought that was just the projector then but apparently not. Some parts it feels like it just jitters along and other times it's really smooth. Is this intentional or is it just poor animation?•ÈÀ"
Hederbomb Intentional to mimic a comic book•ÈÀ

"Is Fisk the only crime boss in the MCU?No; 1) 'Cottonmouth' was in Luke Cage but was later killed off in episode 8. Luke Cage also has; Mariah Dillard who took over after Cottonmouth's death. 2) Jessica Jones has Kilgrave A.K.A. 'The Purple Man' (originally a; Daredevil villain) in season of her show3) And Daredevil also has; 'Madame Gao' who has ties to Wilson Fisk's criminal activities in a enterprising union between her and his forces. She also has ties to Ninja Clan called; The Hand!4) The clandestined organization called; ""Hydra"" has appeared in first Avengers film (albeit referenced at first in the subplots), Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Agents Of Shield TV series, Agent Carter (set in 1947 there afterwards). And has cell groups who acted like crimelords/bosses occasionally etc's?Other crime bosses from the comics like; Silvermane and Hammerhead haven't turned up yet.

I think not the sam remys film where Sony film so they Can Do that•ÈÀ
Agent 2514 if that's the case then why is Spider-man wearing the mask when in Spidey 2 Spider-man's mask is off. Its just a reference to the Raimi trilogy just like Spider-man PS4 referenced all three movie reboots and even other games.•ÈÀ
@TharjaIBW dude not everything has to be the exact same oml•ÈÀ
"He's using a web shooter rather than organic, so not exactly, I guess.•ÈÀ"
"Agent 2514 if they were going for a Raimi trilogy they would have hired Toby Maguire for Spider-man, like how they hired Nicholas Cage for Noir.Its a reference, Spider-man media has been referencing Spider-man 2 for over a decade now.•ÈÀ"

"Not ""normal"" Spider-man, Spider-man 92683.•ÈÀ"

"DayTripper He‰Ûªs not the best Spider-Man, he‰Ûªs just the best peter, arguably.•ÈÀ"

How? The concepts of all theses different worlds have existed for a while.•ÈÀ
"well they have i know, but i think they should focus on ONE Spiderman movie franchise at a time, not have the home coming one which was brutal and then have a kids one, i would say I'm fine with the idea but i think it would fit better as a tv show. I wish they'd go back to classic spider man in NYC like the old ones, no more futuristic stuff•ÈÀ"
@Tim Beck you need to understand that they are different. Homecoming is mcu. This movie is Sony's own creation•ÈÀ
Anybody know the song from 1:01?•ÈÀ
game or movie•_Ù•ÈÀ
We neeeed an mcu miles•ÈÀ

Hell yea... i saw that and ice cream truck memories of my childhood just came flooding back @@•ÈÀ
brings memories lol•ÈÀ
I remember a Spider-Man popsicle thing that was eventually phased out. I ate it everyday after school for as long as it existed. I don‰Ûªt know if I made a mistake or made the most out of a limited product.•ÈÀ
Spider-man gave you diabetes•ÈÀ
I used to eat those a lot as a kid every time the ice cream truck would swing by _Ù÷â_Ù÷â  (see what I did there?)•ÈÀ
I remembe the ice cream truck coming around the block when I was a kid and me and my friends would chase it down with our bikes. I'd always get the spidey pop.. Such good memories. :)•ÈÀ

"Shet , they explain it with the hadron collider?!?!•ÈÀ"
"little info in case someone is not familiar with the other 4 spider people:1:26 Spider-woman (official name)/Gwen Stacy earth-65: basically the roles reverse in this universe and gwen got bitten by a spider instead of peter and peter is the one that kicked the bucket, she's also part of a rock band as evidenced in the trailer.1:35 The Spider-man/Peter Parker earth-90214 (noir universe): the peter in this universe is an investigative reporter for the daily beagle, this spider-man is more agressive and has no problem using lethal force or guns.1:36 SP//dr /Peni Parker earth-14512 (or -8): she's pretty much just a mecha riding spider-girl, and one of the newest addition to the spider-verse.1:40 Spider-ham/Peter Porker earth-8311: ..... it's literally a pig version of spider-man.•ÈÀ"
Actually Spider-Ham has some pretty interesting lore if you look in to it•ÈÀ
Spider-ham is a Spider got bitten by a pig•ÈÀ
"Poppy Scungilli oh I know, that's why I said little info, it's just to get you started.•ÈÀ"
Omar Reyes I respect that•ÈÀ
rather good trailer. am kinda looking forward to this movie.•ÈÀ
Dont usually watch stuff liek this but this looks kind of dope. Whats up with the 3d shading type stuff tho seems kind of off•ÈÀ
Is Sony actually starting to get Spider-Man right???•ÈÀ
"Is that the Rami universe?!•ÈÀ"
"It's probably not because he got webshooters,but this Spidey will be probably bit more like Tobey Mcguire's Spider-Man in some ways. I'm really hyped for this•ÈÀ"

This Boondocks reboot sure looks weird.•ÈÀ

"Who is spider fan ?Ans : I am .•ÈÀ"
Looks great•ÈÀ
What is music?•ÈÀ
"Well this trailer lost me. Did we really need to make it a multidimensional end of the world story, built to set up multiple spin offs? It would‰Ûªve been fine if it was just a simple story in one dimension about an older Peter Parker passing the torch to a young Miles Morales. Now with seven other main characters, there‰Ûªs no room for a character arc on Miles‰Ûª part, and the movie as a whole exists to set up ANOTHER cinematic universe. But I should‰Ûªve guessed. It‰Ûªs Sony, masters of screwing up Spider-Man and screwing up cinematic universes.•ÈÀ"
Miles is still the main character so he'll have his arc•ÈÀ
Mike Morro But why do we need to throw in all these other Spider-Man characters? What do they add to the story? It should be just about Peter teaching Miles and keeping it at that. All these other characters literally exist to advertise spin offs.•ÈÀ
this looks to cheerful I'm tired of happy endings let there be a sacrafice none of them are immortal peter looks mid age maybe he should go•ÈÀ
When they use Raimi's trilogy as canon. <3•ÈÀ
"John Mulaney is Spider-Ham.This is the greatest Spiderman movie ever made.•ÈÀ"
"When they reference the older movies and ice cream, you know it‰Ûªs gonna be good•ÈÀ"
"Seriously, forget Venom, this is a million times better!•ÈÀ"
In other words... SAM RAIMI'S SPIDER-MAN 4: SHATTERED DIMENSIONS•ÈÀ
Count Sapphire yeah. I need this. That train scene animated was the best•ÈÀ
"Since this doesn't look like hot garbage, I'd say no it isn't.•ÈÀ"
@Joel Berggren so you're a hater of the Sam Raimi Trilogy?•ÈÀ
@Joel Berggren WHOA THERE! Sam Raimi's trilogy was awesome!•ÈÀ
@Joel Berggren Yea it is the best but i agree if u compare the raimi trilogy with todays marvel films yea•ÈÀ
Nah Spider-Verse. They never met in shattered•ÈÀ
Count Sapphire basically•ÈÀ
"Joel Berggren There was the Upside Down kiss, the train scene, the scene where a car crashes into Peter's date. It's all one after the other in this trailer.I can't help but to believe this Spiderman is supposed to be a good fan service for people who liked the Sam Raimi films.•ÈÀ"
@Joel Berggren wrong. That's the other spider man•ÈÀ
OH HELL NAW YOUJUST DID NOT DISS THE SAM RAMI TRIOLGY•ÈÀ
but ANIMATED•ÈÀ
@Ryan Carless But in the 2002 film peter removed his mask while at that very train saving scene..didn't he? Whereas in this trailer(movie) he kept it with him.•ÈÀ
"@T Gamerz he also didn't go on a date with Mary Jane in public with his spiderman outfit on in the process. I think it was just for back story effect, personally I wouldn't take too much of a notice of it.•ÈÀ"

This looks amazing!!_Ù÷¨_Ù÷¨_Ù÷Ä_Ù÷ã•ÈÀ
Eyyy it's Spider-Ham!•ÈÀ
"Spider 2099, scarlet spider, ????•ÈÀ"
"Okay, I got to admit, I'm really loving the different art styles for the Spider heroes in this trailer. Peni Parker gets a clearly anime influenced designed, Spider-Ham looks like an exaggerated kids cartoon, Noir is very bold and dark, and Spider-Gwen's universe is heavy on the neon pink and punkish colors. It's clever details like these that make me love animation!•ÈÀ"
Makes me wonder what they could do with the other Spider-men•ÈÀ
A live action spiderverse would be awesome too•ÈÀ
"Personally I'm glad they're going the animation route because managing an entire universe of Spider-Men universes not only would be super daunting for a live action series, but also because animation really allows them to toy with each universe's different styles to really make them stand out.•ÈÀ"
Man Gwen is UUUGLY in this movie! Whats with the buck teeth+ piercing combo?•ÈÀ
"Oh my god, is that Spy//dr? She needs more love•ÈÀ"
Now that's the type of cartoon kids should be watching instead of stupid baby shark do do do do do ...•ÈÀ
Two spider-man's in the same universe•ÈÀ

December 14.•ÈÀ
somebody explain the adorable anime girl to me PLZ!!!•ÈÀ
"Nevermind, just read up on Earth-14512, all good•ÈÀ"
Peni Parker•ÈÀ
Why only in cinemas this Christmas does it not get a full theatrical release? I definitely think that it deserves it•ÈÀ
Matt Sullivan Only in theatres means it won't release on any special app and won't be available for streaming until DVD's come out.•ÈÀ
"Okay , now we have Spiderman Noir and Spider-Ham but ..... Where is Spiderman 2099 ? Its still from another dimension•ÈÀ"
2:16 is that Ned from homecoming•ÈÀ
Song at the begining and end?•ÈÀ
I dont like this Peter Parker's voice. It doesnt sound right imo•ÈÀ
THE STORY UNTOLD cuz hes old af•ÈÀ
Its tobey maguire spiderman•ÈÀ
"The fact that he said, ""Double-tap to release"". Video-game references yo•ÈÀ"
A  new game changer...•ÈÀ
I can understand why theyre not using Tobeys voice for this. (look at the videogames for proof) but hey at least use his costume!•ÈÀ
Can yall stop milking spiderman ffs•ÈÀ
To many spiders _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â but why•ÈÀ
"I'm actually really sad now, I wanted this movie to be JUST Miles and Peter, this is the first time we see Miles in a movie and it would cool if Peter was like his Uncle Ben, but now there's like ten other Spider-People, this doesn't feel like an origin for Miles it feels like Sony trying to make another cinematic universe to make money.•ÈÀ"
yes they should make no money. then what happens.•ÈÀ
2099?•ÈÀ
"Dad , i love you _Ù÷_Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
0:11 Toby maguire reference•ÈÀ
"Some people are not liking the stop-motion style animation of this movie.I actually like it.Reminds me a lot of Laika's stop-motion work.The swap between character styles (Especially Spider-Ham and Peni Parker's styles) are phenomenal. I'm looking forward to seeing this movie.•ÈÀ"
"Next time Thor will be an Afro-American.•ÈÀ"
Good•ÈÀ
"I love that the tracklist for his Christmas album includes ""It's Beginning to Look A Lot Like A Non-Denominational Holiday""•ÈÀ"
This could actually  be  good. Made me laugh at some points. I wouldn't  mind seeing  it.•ÈÀ
Best part 2:20_Ù÷â•ÈÀ

"Well, I mean, Spider-verse was trash as hell lol. I think this is just them setting up future spider movies.•ÈÀ"
but where is Italian Spiderman•ÈÀ
"Remember guys, what makes you different is what makes YOU Spiderman•ÈÀ"
"But I thought the whole point of Spider-Man was it‰Ûªs still your every day guy with problems like you and me, who happens to be a super-hero so anyone can be Spider-Man. Or something like that.•ÈÀ"
Monika that means a lot. Lets all be spiderman!•ÈÀ
@LukaCola It is but let's forget that for the sake of watching this movie in a better light.•ÈÀ
"LukaCola A relatable Peter Parker went out the window as soon as he switched bodies with Doc Ock for two years. Then he had his own successful tech company, which isn‰Ûªt exactly relatable for most people. Let‰Ûªs face it. It‰Ûªs all about ‰ÛÏthe event‰Û or ‰ÛÏthe message‰Û in comics now instead of ‰ÛÏthe characters‰Û. Heck, they even did a Civil War II just to have a Civil War II.•ÈÀ"
@LukaCola Well I think he means every Spiderman is differant from each other and THAT makes it Special•ÈÀ

Ok I cant be the only one who thinks Gwen at 1:44 looks like ruby rose•ÈÀ
"Ok so the different Spiderman and women it will be good each have their own personality and distinctions. The plot seems really good and looks straight out of the comics. The animation you'll either like the style which to be fair is really good or seizure inducing. Overall looks really good.•ÈÀ"
"Hey, look. That's a movie that I won't see on theaters. _ÙÔ•ÈÀ"
Ok I cant be the only one who thinks Gwen at 1:44 looks like ruby rose•ÈÀ

UGH! CANT WAIT!•ÈÀ
"This is the second time Peter Parker‰Ûªs Spider-man started breaking the 4th wall since Disney‰Ûªs Ultimate Spider-man tv show, because he already acknowledges being in comics, cereal boxes and... Christmas albums? I know the Ninja Turtles had a Christmas Album called we wish you a Turtle Christmas, but I don‰Ûªt recall spidey having a Christmas album except some Christmas specials in Spider-man comics and TV cartoons, so why does Peter Parker the Original Spider-man like breaking the 4th wall like Deadpool these days? Awesome new trailer by the way.•ÈÀ"
The soundtrack gave me Spider-Man TAS vibes near the end the whole movie is a love letter to the wall crawler and all his glory and for that I think you Sony•ÈÀ

"This is Miles's movie not Gwen or spider-ham's give proper development to Miles he's lazily written enoughI'm all for spider-man noir and spider-ham but if Miles doesn't get proper development here then he will be written the same again and again•ÈÀ"

Spider pig in this confirmed classic•ÈÀ
Black panther is Spider-Man.......•ÈÀ
"People, it‰Ûªs kinda dumb not to see the movie because of 1 person supporting Antifa. Sure it sucks, but the animators worked very hard on it and the movie has 3 directors. Not 1, but 3. Not seeing the movie just because 1 person is a bad apple is just dumb. I‰Ûªm gonna see the movie, hype!•ÈÀ"

"In this movie the villains for the moment are...Kingpin, Prowler (Miles Morales' uncle), Tombstone, Scorpion and Ultimate Green Goblin (the big green dragon-like thing).•ÈÀ"
Yeah this might be more epic than far from home•ÈÀ
This is a childhood dream come true _Ù÷•ÈÀ
Meh...•ÈÀ
"Welp.Apology accepted Sony.•ÈÀ"
"Okay Marvel comic book fans, who the hell is the anime girl Spiderman supposed to be? A young version of Silk?!•ÈÀ"
Peni Parker aka Sp//dr.  She was created by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance.•ÈÀ
"idk but this is going to be cringy with that anime girlcause it was really suppose to be a japanese spidey•ÈÀ"
Bongo Bongo peni Parker. She has a spider mech•ÈÀ
The first time I saw the spider verse was in ultimate spider Web warriors and it was good•ÈÀ

I like Gwen's Haircut it suits her status as a punk rocker•ÈÀ
Uhm. More please. Also gonna see Venom on the 5th.•ÈÀ

....The voice is wrong. Very wrong.•ÈÀ
Zoya Aly nope they're all fine•ÈÀ
that is your conscience talking. tell it no.•ÈÀ
Nicholas Cage voicing Spider man? I think not.•ÈÀ
"These are supposed to be different takes on the characters, so they are going to be different from what you're used to.•ÈÀ"
My name is morales•ÈÀ
Cant wait for this movie•ÈÀ
1:39 Omg they put the ps4 suit•ÈÀ
So it‰Ûªs based off of the Sam Rami Spider-Man cause all the things in the beginning are things that happened in the movies.•ÈÀ

There is a mistake on the car it isn't PDNY ITS NYPD HIT A LIKE IF YOU AGREE•ÈÀ
Maybe... There are many more Spiderman.... They haven't shown all of them in the trailer•ÈÀ
The director of this movie supports Fascism and Antifa.  He calls for violence against people with different beliefs.•ÈÀ
"Just the director, but not the producers or the animators.•ÈÀ"
"Yea never said anything about anyone but the DIRECTOR.  Funny I haven't seen Sony come out and say we don't stand behind the comments.  Look at James Gunn, fired for 10 yr old joke tweets,  this dope actually calls for violence and nothing happens.•ÈÀ"
"Is this stop motion? Why is the animation so clunky? I'm confused, help. :(•ÈÀ"
Dope AF.•ÈÀ
Last scene is hillarious _Ù÷â_ÙÔÎ•ÈÀ
"Es necesario esa exageraciÌ_n de chistes? Espera, es una pelÌ_cula para niÌ±os? No sorprende que se pasen con el humor actualmente. A ver si el futuro serÌÁ una comedia.•ÈÀ"
Anyone notice the animation is exactly how comic pictures are? _ÙĞ•ÈÀ
"Panels, yes and I love it•ÈÀ"
Gariks Merem that's kinda the point lol•ÈÀ
Gariks Merem and i love it•ÈÀ
"No why would you say that?/s•ÈÀ"
Yeah! _Ù÷ã_Ù÷ã_Ù÷ã•ÈÀ
That‰Ûªs more than likely the point ha•ÈÀ
Thanks Sherlock.•ÈÀ
Gariks Merem you‰Ûªre a fucking genius. Omg how did you figure that out?•ÈÀ
Dope!!!!!•ÈÀ
It's interesting•ÈÀ
Gariks Merem Yes especially the scenes of Spider-Gwen‰Ûªs home world. It looks exactly like her comic with the the neon colors.•ÈÀ
You don't say ?•ÈÀ
I picked it up at 0:57 lol•ÈÀ
flip page animation if u look close at up close characters.•ÈÀ
breaking news•ÈÀ
Gariks Merem yes•ÈÀ
That's kinda what they were going for.•ÈÀ
Yo men you are right.•ÈÀ
The trailer might be better than the movie•ÈÀ
This looks so good!!!•ÈÀ
"This movie is so unbelievable...Peter can't grow facial hair.•ÈÀ"
I was made for this move irl my name is like miles Morales but just no Morales•ÈÀ
lol•ÈÀ
1:39•ÈÀ
Where's Spiderman 2099?•ÈÀ

The visuals in this movie are brilliant.•ÈÀ
JOHN MULANEY AHHHHHHHHHH•ÈÀ
"OMFG. Can't be more thrilled.December, please come quickly.•ÈÀ"

I have seen these episodes when I was in childhood•ÈÀ
i don't know if it's possible to hype this movie up even more•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm actually excited•ÈÀ
What if they make Casey neither the spider man of some random Universe ?•ÈÀ
OMG I CAN'T EVEN SPIDER-HAM IS JOHN MULANEY AND SPIDER-MAN NOIR IS NICOLAS CAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
2:02 top right looks like a spider suit but no webbings and it looks like a boot so it could be a possible homade suit•ÈÀ
ps4 exclusive again ??•ÈÀ
So Raimi films and Webb films ALL HAPPENED?!?!•ÈÀ
Thanks a lot Sony now I need Christmas to come even faster also is Spider-Man noir voiced by Nicholas cage?•ÈÀ

2099•ÈÀ
I am in love with this.... But hold your horses where's Peter nerd Parker ?•ÈÀ
"He is similar to Dante, old.•ÈÀ"
Black spider man_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
The animations look incredible. It would be so cool to see other Superhero movies done with this art style.•ÈÀ
I want dc to do a flash movie like this separate from all the other stuff like it's it's on universe•ÈÀ
If this movie is successful we might see more follow suit. Fingers crossed!•ÈÀ
Imagine an animated Deadpool Corpse movie•ÈÀ
@SauSageBoi man I am waiting for flash movie to be different. I hope Shazam changes tone of DC universe as well•ÈÀ
I prefer the manga dc style animations....to each their own to stay original..also there seem to be frames missing•ÈÀ
"@Viral Vine i don't want to chance it all but for characters who are light-hearted like flash and shazam but who is supposed to be serious or ""dark"" i want to stay so•ÈÀ"
Not all heroes will be suited to this animation style. But yeah this looks awesome.•ÈÀ
@SauSageBoi ya correctly put. Balance is required as well•ÈÀ
Brasil•ÈÀ
This is so cool_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷÷•ÈÀ
Hah!•ÈÀ
"""I will start with the fact that I am Spider-Man, because that is a given. Then for backstory I will pepper in the fact that I am a talking pig."" Which, I know it's difficult for livestock, but that's not a reason for money.•ÈÀ"
"Who the F**k dislikes this stuff, i dont get it.•ÈÀ"
1:50 Peter Kavinsky as Dad•ÈÀ
I see insomniacs spiderman suit in the background behind aunt may•ÈÀ
man you're right! it is!•ÈÀ
"This is so cool _Ù÷Although I‰Ûªll miss Spider Woman•ÈÀ"
1:35 NICHOLAS CAGE!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
I project best animated movie of 2018.DEAL WITH IT.•ÈÀ
I'm sorry but I really don't like Jake Johnson's voice as spiderman•ÈÀ
A lot of Easter eggs in this trailer•ÈÀ
The simpsons movie predicted the future . spider pig•ÈÀ
"no they didn't, Spider-Ham was in the comics since the 80's•ÈÀ"
I adore the art style. Can't wait to see this.•ÈÀ
"‰ÛÏDo animals talk in this dimension cuz I don‰Ûªt wanna freak him out‰ÛfaintsMy sides XD•ÈÀ"
But will it make me FEEL like Spiderman?•ÈÀ
I like the noir Spiderman•ÈÀ
He's coming to Spiderman Far from Home too•ÈÀ
Really ?•ÈÀ
@Unlondon yup. There was a photo posted today from the shooting spot and he's wearing the Noir suit. Or something very similar•ÈÀ
Nice•ÈÀ
I always loved the noir suit•ÈÀ
It looks so cool•ÈÀ
Please release this movie in hindi in India•ÈÀ
Ya know what? I'm on bored for this•ÈÀ
Can anyone tell me the name of song playing in background?•ÈÀ
"Que legal esse filme vai ser show demais, caramba _ÙÔ‰_•ÈÀ"
I dunno about y'all but I'd listen to the Christmas album.•ÈÀ
"This looks great.""Do animals talk in this dimension cause I dont wanna freak him out""•ÈÀ"
What's better is the guitar towards the end of the trailer when everything is all going down sounds a bit like the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. Sounds so awesome. I'm hyped for this more than Venom.•ÈÀ
I thought Spiderman was back on MCU. But sony uploaded the trailer. This is confusing•ÈÀ
How come Peter Parker not know who Gwen Stacy is ??•ÈÀ
Might not be the same Gwen Stacy as the one in his universe•ÈÀ
"Well he knows about him being a comic book hero, a merchandise and popsicle, he has broken 4th wall, I guess he should know who Gwen Stacy is.•ÈÀ"
I think that means this Spider-man franchised his name out to different brands•ÈÀ
Ayushraj Mehrotra he didnt know who she was behind the mask since spider gwen isnt from his universe•ÈÀ
Omg! Omg! Omg! Omg! Omg!•ÈÀ
"Not gonna lie, that looks dope•ÈÀ"
Bad idea!! Can't see my childhood superhero getting any worse•ÈÀ
"OKAY! Who is that little girl who seems to have the robot spider, honestly is it new reiteration of Spider-Man we've never seen before cause I'm not sure I've seen her before•ÈÀ"
awesome•ÈÀ
Meh!•ÈÀ
Gwen Stacy lookin like a snack•ÈÀ
2:36 has the PS4 suit!!•ÈÀ
You do realize that most of the suits in that game were based off of the comics right•ÈÀ
1:39 spider man PS4 suit next to aunt may.•ÈÀ
Nice catch•ÈÀ
This style of drawing characters reminds me a lot of Telltale;/•ÈÀ
This is... AWESOME!!!!! Can‰Ûªt wait to see this movie.•ÈÀ
"Today I listened to pusha t's nostalgia ft Kendrick,and this guitar reminds off it•ÈÀ"
Go listen to Taco Hemingway - Nostalgia•ÈÀ
SPIDER-HAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
Danny Devito should‰Ûªve voiced Spider Ham•ÈÀ
But then he wouldn‰Ûªt be able to eat Rum Ham•ÈÀ
1:37 kawaiii desu nee....•ÈÀ
A greek themed store In an English video ? pretty rare to see•ÈÀ
Who else is waiting for charlie to push out a video in the next couple hours for this?•ÈÀ
"WaitSpidey died•ÈÀ"
This movie looks great and funny _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
I just found my new crush _Ù÷‰_•ü #GwenStacy•ÈÀ
Kundan spidey i just found mine #spider-ham•ÈÀ
"if you said the loliFBI would have had to take action•ÈÀ"
Kundan spidey naaww she's mine xD•ÈÀ
"I prefer Gwen from the comics, this version seems like she is going to be edgy and annoying from the vibes I got off the trailer, we will need to wait and see though•ÈÀ"
"Bary Baragon i think they are both great but Gwen in this movie doesn't seem all that edgy to me from what is there to see yet, but i think she was also a  little bit edgy in the Comics•ÈÀ"
Kundan spidey eww she looks disgusting imo•ÈÀ
its look really awsum .....•ÈÀ
1:39 I saw Spider-Man PS4 Advanced suit by aunt May's left shoulder•ÈÀ
Yes _Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷•ÈÀ
Holy identity politics Batman.•ÈÀ
Love how they integrate all those characters.  Looks extremely dynamic. Really looking forward to this!•ÈÀ
They actually did the train scene from Sam raimi‰Ûªs Spider-Man _ÙªÎ_Ù__ÙªÎ_Ù_•ÈÀ
And the upside down kiss too.•ÈÀ
Anyone notice that expensive bill 1:07•ÈÀ
"No, nice eye. Lol it's $30,000.•ÈÀ"
Its new york every thing is expensive•ÈÀ
"Looks great, too bad the director supports ANTIFA and is a racist piece of sht.•ÈÀ"

Wtf such a great trailer•ÈÀ
Why is Gwen so goddamn hot?•ÈÀ
This is a crap idea!•ÈÀ
Song name?•ÈÀ
Noir Spider-Man !!!!•ÈÀ
I have a feeling the Peter Parker Spiderman is the Tobey maguire version•ÈÀ
"Lots of references there, and I'm so glad they went this route! ^_^•ÈÀ"
Big if true. It even shows scenes of the train and him with mj at that diner•ÈÀ
Probably but the actor isn‰Ûªt Tobey Maguire•ÈÀ
yup•ÈÀ
Yo I can't wait for this!!!•ÈÀ
"Anime Spider mech Girl _ÙÔ¤_ÙÈ?!? Sold. take my money•ÈÀ"
"Why is a Peter Parker so much like John Cusak and how old is he, like 36-7?? Geesh, it‰Ûªs weird seeing him portrayed in that way, he seems too bored or something.•ÈÀ"
I cant wait to watch this!! _Ù÷•ÈÀ
"Spider-man NOIRRRR !!!! Wow the trailer is more amazing than I expected. Hope the movie will be, too.•ÈÀ"
"ONLY WATCHING FOR JOHN MULANEYAND SPIDER-MAN SPIDER HAM•ÈÀ"
Stupid to not have Spiderman in venom•ÈÀ
But Spidey was dead !!!•ÈÀ
So this is spiderman avengers tho?•ÈÀ
Okay so that's super cool Nic Cage is doing Noir but is that John Mulaney playing spider-pig? _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
1:37 can someone tell me what spider verse she's from I dont recognize her•ÈÀ
Dz zl That‰Ûªs Peni Parker and Sp//dr.•ÈÀ
Spider noir!!!!!!!!!!!!! ‰ª´•ÈÀ
OMG!!!. That so cool•ÈÀ
awesome thank you I really want to watch it•ÈÀ
"Hope Peter has some kinda visceral reaction to seeing Gwen/Spider-Gwen and the other way around, before it‰Ûªs played off for laughs. You know the whole ‰ÛÏyour supposed to be dead, no your supposed to dead‰Û kinda gag•ÈÀ"
Yes. Yes. Yes and OMFG YESSSSS!!!•ÈÀ
1:37 what this hero name•ÈÀ
1:44 - On the right - Tom Holland's Spider-man: Far from home costume?•ÈÀ
Brick FORCE Studios no that‰Ûªs Spider-Man noir from the comics in a different universe•ÈÀ
Brick FORCE Studios it‰Ûªs the Spider-Man: noir suit. NOT the suit from far from home. If anything the far from home suit pays homage to the noir suit.•ÈÀ
Thats noir ._.•ÈÀ
That's noir. the leaked footage might be a homeage to it or the stealth suit•ÈÀ
Looks more like the Secret Wars Suit•ÈÀ
Brick FORCE Studios you not a real fan•ÈÀ
Did u rlly just say that??•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
Noir•ÈÀ
"That suit isn't noir, it has a blue stripe on the eyes•ÈÀ"
"He means the suits in the show casings, not when they're standing together•ÈÀ"
I think hes talking about the suits in the tubes at 44 not them standing at 45•ÈÀ
Spider noir•ÈÀ
I wonder if Tom Holland's Spidey will appear in this movie as well•ÈÀ
No no of course not•ÈÀ
That's spider noir he's from 1950s•ÈÀ
Lucass uncultured swine•ÈÀ
Is for noire.•ÈÀ
he‰Ûªs talking about the costumes in the capsules•ÈÀ
Noir is Nicolas Cage•ÈÀ
Brick FORCE Studios at 1:39 you can see the Spider-Man PS4 suit behind the lady next to  spider-Gwen•ÈÀ
Gwen is even more BAE now and nobody dares and call her Thicc ! You better not...•ÈÀ
Yeeeeeeh !   I'm waitingggggg•ÈÀ
"THEY HAVE SPIDER NOIR!!AAND SPIDER HAM ??man.. this is a good year for spidey!•ÈÀ"
Spider Steamed Hams•ÈÀ
1.56 : is that scorpion?•ÈÀ

And Tombstone left behind him•ÈÀ
"At least they to want us to own a PlayStation to see the movie,Hopefully.•ÈÀ"
Oh I'm gonna fall in love•ÈÀ
with spider pig•ÈÀ
Well with all of the spidey dimension!•ÈÀ
.....forced diversity at its best yet again!•ÈÀ
"WakeUpDead2021 how about you crawl back to basement you came out of. The regular Spider-Man is still white and in the movies as well as the game that is still the same. This movie isn‰Ûªt about that Spider-Man. It‰Ûªs about Miles Morales. A different one, guess you aren‰Ûªt smart enough to comprehend that.•ÈÀ"
"Yeah, forced diversity even though Miles Morales has been around in the comics for nearly a decade•ÈÀ"
WakeUpDead2021 another idiot•ÈÀ
MARVEL DOES IT BETTER...•ÈÀ
"Time to pre-order for that Christmas Album, l want Spidey, it's cold outside•ÈÀ"

Did anyone kno vin diesel is his dad•ÈÀ
i fucking love that artstyle. This finna be dope•ÈÀ
Lovely•ÈÀ
When they said or had thoughts about the new spider man being black I didnt have an animated film in mind_Ù_á‰Û‰ªâ•ü guess that's the only way 4 us..smh still gonna see it•ÈÀ
"omg stop with your politics, its Miles Morales, he has his own comics and is a separate character. JEEZ man you americans always gotta get political with your left right bullshit.•ÈÀ"
Miles Morales isn't even a new spiderman if he was in the comics since 2011 lmao•ÈÀ
2:30 is it me or is this a little Easter egg saying that black panther will make an appearance•ÈÀ
"Idk if he'll make an appearanceBut is that A Panther Statue (Sort of)Reference to Black Panther?•ÈÀ"
I'm hoping it's a tease for Leopardon. No better addition to the climax than a giant megazord piloted by an emissary from Hell.•ÈÀ
Too many Spider-Man movies•ÈÀ
Cool...•ÈÀ
Who‰Ûªs the girl with the badass spider-bot•ÈÀ

THANK YOU•ÈÀ
"okay okay this looks UNBELEIVABLE. AMAZING. (see what I did there.)but if your gonna give spider-gwen pointe shoes at least do the research to make it correct technique. when she lands in the tree she WOULD NOT be on her shoes the way she is. her feet would be fully pointed, ankles fully extended, and she would be resting on the front of shoes. the way she is sitting, (@ 1:25) there is NO support for her body. and she would be in immense pain if she sat like that for more than 2 milliseconds. you CAN NOT be on pointe and have your ankles bent. it's poor technique, it's dangerous, and you will not be allowed to do pointe without strong ankles (its literally like requirement number 1).PLS HALPplease fix this. please.•ÈÀ"
Does anyone know who is voicing Noir? This is very important!•ÈÀ
It's Nicholas Cage•ÈÀ
It thought it was peter who thought there was only 1 spider man•ÈÀ

"Kinda surprised they changed Sp//der's look that much, but at least it still looks cool.•ÈÀ"
Why does every new main character have to be black? It‰Ûªs really annoying. Why not Mexican or Native American? The people who actually own this land and should be use to promote Native culture and people but no just black People.•ÈÀ
I mean miles isn't just black  tho he's also been portayed as Latin and sometimes half and half. The only really reason they go with black miles is because it's his most common depiction over the years that he has been spiderman.•ÈÀ
cool•ÈÀ

@it's not an actual channel believe me mine was sitting on a Radio that is still Active ;)•ÈÀ
That was really badass how Spider-Man just punched the hell out of that car that I'm sure was a nod to the Spider-Man 2 film. Probably flew back and smacked Dr. Octavius in his smug face. I say that's how it should've ended.•ÈÀ
"After watching the trailer I feel so good•ÈÀ"
1:39 LOOK BEHIND AUNT MAY HOLY SHOT•ÈÀ
Liked the concept but what's with that stuttering?•ÈÀ

Pretty telling that the most interesting thing about a Miles Morales film... isn't Miles Morales.•ÈÀ

Nicholas Cage as SpiderMan Noir I am in•ÈÀ
English is spoken in whatever number of dimensions that exist.•ÈÀ

"Why does the thumbnail look like a Anorexic Spiderman?•ÈÀ"
am i the only one whos excited for this movie?•ÈÀ
"I love the comic book styling, but the stop motion 12 fps style is really grating with such intense action. It worked in the LEGO Movie, because it fit the content, but in this it just feels wrong and makes me feel slightly nauseous (and I'm a big 3D fan, who pretty much never gets nauseous).•ÈÀ"
Virou moda Spiderman•ÈÀ

I speak for all Spider-Man fans when peter says ‰ÛÏyou‰Ûªre like me‰Û it resonates with our soul‰Ûªs.•ÈÀ
AYYYYYYYYEEEEEEE•ÈÀ
Why does Peter Parker not recognize Gwen Stacy?•ÈÀ
Nicolas G because that Gwen is from a different universe•ÈÀ
Would have been much more fun if the story was based on only Peter Parker•ÈÀ

"Omg! Peni Parker is so cute!! Gwen is so lovely! And bloody hell, the suit from PS4 Spider-Man! Also its been announced that the Peter Parker from the game will be canon in a new Spiderverse storyline called Spidergeddon or something....•ÈÀ"
It is Spidergeddon. Looks like the Insomniac Spider-Man's been welcomed into much loving arms :)•ÈÀ
Whoa really?•ÈÀ
Awesome news :O•ÈÀ
"@nickman317 makes sense, the game is incredible, and the swinging can challenge Spiderman 2 (it's an opinion)•ÈÀ"
"@Ryan Anthony Yea, he's introduced in Spidergeddon #0 when Superior Spider-Man shows up and brings him into what's going on. Insomniac's Spidey is actually set in Earth-1048.•ÈÀ"
Penis Parker?•ÈÀ
"Olle Selin Peni Parker. She's the anime girl. Basically, she's Spider-Mech.•ÈÀ"
Everything marvel is canon though.•ÈÀ
@Pro Bot not true...two words... fantastic four•ÈÀ

Wait is this in the Rami universe? 00:10•ÈÀ
"No, is just an homage to the Raimi trilogy.•ÈÀ"
marvelousdcgeek 97 but do we know that for certain? Keep asking questions•ÈÀ
I have the felling this'll be The Lego Batman Movie of Spider-man•ÈÀ
1:37 Shadman and Deviantart intensify•ÈÀ
Is no one gonna talk about the weeb Peni Parker•ÈÀ
"Officer, love youHaha wait what•ÈÀ"
I WANTED SPIDERMAN 2099 BUT IT'S GOOD•ÈÀ
I would have replaced the one from 1:37 for him. I mean I‰Ûªm a big spider-man fan but am I the only one who has never heard off her or she just might have been created for this film•ÈÀ
I would've replaced Aunt May where SHE is the spider-man in her universe. I mean one funny character is enough (Spider-Ham)•ÈÀ
@Lil Hedgehog thats peni paker i think•ÈÀ
"Her name is Penny Parker, she is one of the original characters of the Spider-verse comic, although this version of her is very different from the one in the comics. (Sorry if I spelled something wrong, English is not my native language)•ÈÀ"
Thx guys•ÈÀ
I have a feeling that THIS is going to be my favorite Spider-Man movie!•ÈÀ
That might be your Spidey senses telling you :)•ÈÀ
"I think it will be great, but nothing can top Spidey 2 imo•ÈÀ"
Jared Martin everything can but I guess it‰Ûªs all just opinion•ÈÀ
Venom lookin good too•ÈÀ
Im sure old spidey is gonna sacrafice himself for miles•ÈÀ
"2:20 our guy in the chair, Ned_Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
That's Ganke•ÈÀ
He better be fucking named like that•ÈÀ
Its actually Ganke Miles' friend.•ÈÀ
I NEED A MEDIC BAG!!! I thought it was Ned from the MCU•ÈÀ
Nah thats ganke nigga. Ned is basically a copy of ganke•ÈÀ
"@Grave Mind No, Ned in the MCU is based off Ganke from the ultimate comics he was Miles' friend.•ÈÀ"
"In the MCU, they basically took Ganke (Miles‰Ûª Asian best friend and roommate) and renamed him Ned Leeds (a Caucasian reporter Pete met as an adult who eventually married Betty Brant). The confusion‰Ûªs understandable. I wonder who came up with this idea for Homecoming. Tbh, it‰Ûªd probably be better if MCU‰Ûªs Ned was a character made specifically for the MCU, just like Coulson.•ÈÀ"
"In the comics, Ganke Lee adopted the name Ned to hide his true identity from Danika Hart. Both Ganke Lee and Ned Leeds share similarities, they both like superheroes and LEGO and their physical appearance•ÈÀ"
Ganke Spanke•ÈÀ
"Mister Who Ganke is very similar to Ned Leeds from the MCU but not the one from Earth-616. Not the original Ned Leeds. Edit: Sorry. I still think giving Ganke someone else‰Ûªs name makes conversations like this a little confusing. _Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
This movie is gonna be great!•ÈÀ
i saw the same movie on disney xd lul•ÈÀ
Its Gonna be BLAST...•ÈÀ
Did anyone notice that Spider-ham has his own art style? He's like a cartoon. Very cool.•ÈÀ

"One critique, this looks a little busy, they have 2 hours to tell their story,  several lead characters, the prowler (Miles' uncle) Kingpin (I think), several other villains, a Miles' family dynamic, an MJ relationship dynamic, a catastrophic universe bending collider arc etc. etc. I hope they can balance it all within the time and still make everything feel valuable without being 5 hours long•ÈÀ"

best cinematic version of Peter Parker•ÈÀ
The Cloverfield Paradox!!!•ÈÀ
This hangs more than pubg•ÈÀ
Is spider-pig a simpsons reference?•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham was a thing on the comics back in the 80s.•ÈÀ

"Yeah, I agree•ÈÀ"
I mean... have you seen the title? It is loosely based off THE COMIC!!! The soider verse is a real thing and anyway you are literally only seeing a preview. For all we know Peter could disappear or die.•ÈÀ
ThatRandomGuy Calm down.•ÈÀ
@Brandon Yates I am calm? Lol what•ÈÀ
Whats wrong with miles having screen time?•ÈÀ
"@10,000 subscribers with Only one video Not everyone wants miles to be in the spotlight. Think it has to do with growing up with Peter Parker•ÈÀ"
Well it can't be a spider-verse without at least five spidermen.•ÈÀ
Dark Beast131 well if you read the comics everyone loves him and wouldn‰Ûªt mind. He takes over as Spider-Man when Peter dies anyways. All of you need to get over it.•ÈÀ
"10,000 subscribers with Only one video  There is absolutely nothing wrong with Miles having screen time, a lot of people like to stick to what they know. And don‰Ûªt like change, I grew up on Peter Parker. But I also like Miles Morales as well, it would have been cool for Miles to have screen time. But the title of the movie gives it away that this movie is not just about Miles.•ÈÀ"

Why bother with that movie? They're just gonna reboot that stuff after.•ÈÀ
"...Can we love both? ""D•ÈÀ"
"@TotallyCarbon nopespiderman will be running on theaters 1 week earlier according to what they've shown on google btw :/•ÈÀ"
"@Manuel Alberto Romero I mean some people will, but the paying public usually doesn't see multiple films back to back, especially ones that target the same audience. So usually one film's audience suffers.•ÈÀ"
@TotallyCarbon I wouldn't say they target the same audience though•ÈÀ
"Not only that, Aquaman and Mary Poppins Returns are also competition, i don't know why studios have to put them close to other movies•ÈÀ"
"If Bumblebee would be a better movie than anything the Bayverse has produced, I wouldn‰Ûªt worry about it. People would want to watch a better Transformers movie. Honestly, I plan on watching both the Bumblebee and the Spider-Verse movies.•ÈÀ"
"cartoons typically never beat live-action films though,•ÈÀ"
As far as I know it seems like Spider-Man and Bumblebee have separate release dates it will do fine. I think Aquaman and Mary Poppins returns also have separate release dates but no doubt December will be a very crowded and hot month for the box office•ÈÀ
"Matt Rodriguez It depends on the writing and direction. A lot of people would choose Transformers Prime over the Bayverse, the DCAU over the DCEU, Spider-Man TAS and/or Spectacular Spider-Man over the TASM movies, etc.•ÈÀ"

RedyTheLegend Its stop motion•ÈÀ
"oooo okay so that is why its so laggy. Coraline looked a bit more fluid tho, i hope they add a bit more framerate smoothness cause it was hard to look at in the fast pace scenes.•ÈÀ"
"It's not stop motion. It's purposefully animated ""on-twos,"" meaning the picture only changes every two frames. It's a style derived from traditional hand-drawn animation, and it's used here to fit the comic book style they're going for.•ÈÀ"
I think Sony is gonna overdo spider man [out of greed for money] and make him exhausted.•ÈÀ

Peter porker has joined the server•ÈÀ
Who here before 1million•ÈÀ
This looks soooo good!•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªm so ready for this!•ÈÀ
So did Peter die in miles universe or did he never exist because if that's the case then that's stupid as hell. I know in the comics he died but I hope they do that in this movie to. I also think if they were gonna do an older Peter then they  should go with him having kids with mj because that could easily lead to a cool spin off.•ÈÀ
"Peter was resurrected after Doctor Octavius‰Ûª run as the Superior Spider Man. I won‰Ûªt spoil how though, The Amazing Spider Man comics have been great lately•ÈÀ"
Oh yes noir•ÈÀ
When you didn‰Ûªt think Spider Qwen could get any cooler!•ÈÀ

Even i want this movie to be banger.. They have all the good elements.. But than those low fps.. I hope it's just in trailer•ÈÀ
It's an intentional choice to recreate a stop motion and comic book look (i.e. the choppiness of jumping from panel to panel).•ÈÀ

"What makes you different....is what makes you spiderman.Also is it just me or is Gwen Stacy hot?•ÈÀ"
They should have called toby maguier to make spidermans voice•ÈÀ
I'm pretty sure he's sick to death of the celebrity attention from what I've seen.•ÈÀ
I would've vomited uncontrollably.•ÈÀ
@Tanner Eads Retard spotted•ÈÀ
Or Josh Keton•ÈÀ
Toby can't voice act•ÈÀ
"By the looks of Original spiderman It tells me a lot years have passed by so it would made sense to give him a different voice•ÈÀ"
@Duffin How do you know that if he hasn't attempted it?•ÈÀ
"@Sandeep Mehta He HAS attempted, dude. He voice acted the movie based games of his 3 movies and he sounds like crap, just like he does in the movies. Him in voicing acting is a lot worse than him speaking in live action.•ÈÀ"
"@Sandeep Mehta Yes he has, pretty sure it in was the spiderman movie games•ÈÀ"
Why are people obsessed with Toby Maguire as spider man•ÈÀ
Only reason I'm disappointed.•ÈÀ
@JustRonhan Because he is the best•ÈÀ
@MZX Omega Lmfao great joke.•ÈÀ
@Duffin Oh okay thanks for the info•ÈÀ
We all know daredevil is the best superhero•ÈÀ
@Bobby Rashford We all know your attempt at cracking jokes is shitty.•ÈÀ
No... they shouldn't have.•ÈÀ
@Bobby Rashford Spider-man is Daredevil 616•ÈÀ
"@A5hTriX Yes, they definitely should have.•ÈÀ"
Toby was like the worst Spider-Man•ÈÀ
Right but this is Fine ‰÷¼•ÈÀ
Toby can't person act either•ÈÀ
"As much as I like Maguire the most as Spider-man, he doesn't really have the best voice talent.•ÈÀ"
PIZZA TIME•ÈÀ
@Duffin sad•ÈÀ
Gustavo Moura Na Tobey Spider-Man days are over•ÈÀ
"Hyperstellar No not really, in fact he has an Instagram page on which he posts about his role as Spider-Man and Spider-Man in general frequently•ÈÀ"
"""Oh boy......""•ÈÀ"
Yuri or Josh Keaton are FAR better•ÈÀ
Toby can't voice act it's a proven fact•ÈÀ
"Duffin yeah, i didnt remember of that•ÈÀ"
"Toby is a bad spiderman, but a good peter parker.•ÈÀ"
I just thot that he could voice act in this because of the scenes from the start of the trailer that show moments from his movies•ÈÀ
"Adam Law i like him as spider man, at least he made his own suit•ÈÀ"
Why he doesn't know who Gwen stacy is_Ù_¬_Ù_¬_Ù_¬wtf•ÈÀ
Probably they edited scenes.•ÈÀ
rafael pozo Gwen is dead in 616 peters universe.•ÈÀ

How lovely would it be if Xbox players weren't allowed to watch this•ÈÀ
Diversity and feminism continuing to butcher classics. I guess today studios and artists are too stupid and lack the creativity to just create new super heroes and instead leech and kill classic super heroes. Lame! Typical of a millenials generation. Useless. lol.•ÈÀ

"@theHardInGame yt Oh, OK. That's make more sense.I still wouldn't want Sony get full control of Spider-Man back, since they were completely clueless with The Amazing Spider-Man movies and Homecoming was the best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2.•ÈÀ"

"Insomniac Developers said if ps4 Spider-Man gets great success, Marvel Game Universe Spider man will be joining Marvel Comics. And just look at 1:39. There's no way that approves PS4 Spider Man does exists in Marvel Comics Universe after success of game release and high rates about them.•ÈÀ"

Is this real Sony actually making a good spider-Man movie am i dreaming•ÈÀ
"They made homecoming, they've made just about every spider man movie, regardless of the universe, weird that people don't seem to get that, if its a Spidey movie, its Sony, they own the film rights and have for a while•ÈÀ"
Only because they have Marvels help.•ÈÀ

"Well I mean Marvel has some strings in this. Sony in this movie is like Marvel's tiny little puppet, for the most part.•ÈÀ"
Spider-man 1 and 2 were great films. It's that certain folk at Sony had some strange ideas for Spider-man forced onto the directors.•ÈÀ
"@JD Marshall Marvel made homecoming, ain't just let them use the rights in exchange for a percentile of the profit•ÈÀ"
"It's real. It's a great job.They can ally us spider in one union•ÈÀ"
"@ZombieDudeGaming They produce Homecoming, but don't make the movie•ÈÀ"
@JD Marshall Sony did not make homecoming yeah their name was in the movie because they own spider Man. but they had nothing to do with the making of the film they didn't even get money for it only marvel studios.•ÈÀ
Of course they got money for it. Otherwise Sony wouldn't have agree to let Marvel use Spider-Man in the MCU.•ÈÀ
cool•ÈÀ
"Prowler, Scorpion, Kingpin, Green Goblin, what other villain are there•ÈÀ"

I heard that venom is a mixed bag•ÈÀ
yes•ÈÀ
No chance...•ÈÀ
My man! Took the words right outta my mouth•ÈÀ
Obviously•ÈÀ
@Madara Venom doesn't include Spider-Man in there universe and there making a trilogy also Sony made the emoji movie not high hopes•ÈÀ
XD•ÈÀ
Can we just enjoy both?Always debating whats better...So pointless•ÈÀ
@The Creator venom could easily be a major disappointment•ÈÀ
Favelize Adventures FACTS!•ÈÀ
"This movie will flop in earnings , venom will flop in bringing people back in . Both will be good but neither will be consider rewatchable in the movie theater .•ÈÀ"
Just no•ÈÀ
Noooo lmaooo•ÈÀ
At this point it‰Ûªs cartoon vs live action.•ÈÀ
It's gonna be better than Homecoming too.•ÈÀ
This Movie is gonna be better than Spider-Man Homecoming.•ÈÀ
Venom is great•ÈÀ
@The Creator Venom has gotten pretty bad reviews.•ÈÀ
"Ha!You wish.•ÈÀ"
"Venom is trash, everyone knows that.•ÈÀ"
press X to doubt•ÈÀ
this is a mixed bag•ÈÀ
"@Xion I don't think Venom is trash , so you're lying and using your own opinion .•ÈÀ"
Can't really judge if you haven't seen the movie yet•ÈÀ
No•ÈÀ
Says the dude that haven't even watched either•ÈÀ
"@Einar Figueras So? It's not like every single movie they make after The Emoji Movie will be bad. Also, 2018 Is almost over. It's basically irrelevant to hate on TEM now.•ÈÀ"
Agree to disagree•ÈÀ
Madara did you see the early reviews?•ÈÀ
Venom is better than homecoming•ÈÀ
no•ÈÀ
your wrong•ÈÀ
crunchybooger Well it's not out yet so no one has except the people who's in it•ÈÀ
@I'mNotMario yes I know we should hate but you gotta be vigilant with venom they don't have a good track record with movies•ÈÀ
Incoming wave of counter arguments... What's that?... I'm too late?... huh... oh well then•ÈÀ
@Angus Fraser I don't care man if steel got bad reviews and that was great•ÈÀ
2:29 is that a reference to the black panther poster?•ÈÀ
Cant wait!!!•ÈÀ
Only comment on this is why does Peter look overweight and middle aged•ÈÀ
An anime character in this movie ok•ÈÀ
It's a spidey from the comics•ÈÀ
It's Peni Parker aka SP//DR•ÈÀ
When you can feel people throwing shade and you ain't having none of it_Ù÷â 0:12•ÈÀ
His dad looks like the character from Charlie with the chance of meatballs•ÈÀ
Is spider-pig from the simpsons?•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham existed since 1983 on the comics.•ÈÀ
Why are people thumbs downing this? How are you not excited for this! Looks so good•ÈÀ
Some people dont like that miles is black•ÈÀ
Schwartzbruder1 wasn't he always then?•ÈÀ
LOW FPS•ÈÀ
Homecoming. Venom. Spider-Man PS4... they're doing it... right?•ÈÀ

I thought so but it's just a lion•ÈÀ

"I was like, I don‰Ûªt know bout this movie, it doesn‰Ûªt connect to any universe. Not the MCU, or anything. But then I see that it connects to the original Spider-Man, and I‰Ûªm like. Oooh that‰Ûªs interesting, plus I see he‰Ûªs aged a bit. Plus... is that Ned at the end?•ÈÀ"
The Ned from homecoming is a copy of the friend of miles I don't remember his name though•ÈÀ
"It doesn't connect to the Raimi Spider-man tho, that was just a refrence. Also why would this have to connect with some universe to peak your interest? Enjoy it for what it is for christ's sake.•ÈÀ"
I don't mind that it doesn't connect to any universe. Though I didn't expect to get some kind of deadpool vibe. I thought it was going to just put a focus on miles morales•ÈÀ
His name is Ganke•ÈÀ
"No, probably he's a friend of Miles whose name is Ganke.•ÈÀ"
Why does this need to be connected to the MCU?•ÈÀ

"@Patrick Because if it's not tied to a cinematic universe, it's not worth watching. It's stupid, I know.•ÈÀ"
@Bort Theattorney It is technically connected by the Spider-verse in some manner and form.•ÈÀ
Not being connected to a cinematic universe gives it more creative freedom. This is why the new Joker movie stands a chance at being really good.•ÈÀ
Is it connected to Tobey‰Ûªs spiderman? I think that‰Ûªs pretty cool.•ÈÀ
Peter ramsay is a douche but this movie looks great.•ÈÀ

@Joshua De Joya yeah•ÈÀ
Imagine if they had got Tobey as the voice actor for Peter in this•ÈÀ
Wider Spider he's not as witty or funny as this actor.•ÈÀ
"Starcrap 64 You realize the actors are reading from a script, right?•ÈÀ"
I like Yuri Lowenthal more•ÈÀ
"Thrawn Mon and you realize actors also have to, you know, ACT?•ÈÀ"
Wider Spider Last time I checked whenever he did a voice over role it wasn‰Ûªt that good•ÈÀ
"_ÙÓ« Already watched ""SPIDER MAN: INTO THE SPIDER VERSE"" Movie t.co/3Hodi5yZnU Unglaublicher film! Sehr zu empfehlen, es auszuprobieren!•ÈÀ"
@Thrawn Mon I think he means more that he lacks charisma and gives a boring performance as the character that people only cherish out of pure nostalgia or the fact that they may not be big fans of the character so they don't really know any other Spider Man all that well and default to the Maguire Spider Man even though the Maguire Spider Man really isn't all that great•ÈÀ
"Dan the Magic Man and Tobey is a good actor, so I fail to see your point•ÈÀ"
In Brazil Peter is being voiced by the same voice actor that did the voice of Toby's spider-man•ÈÀ

"2:22 that‰Ûªs a Ned joke. The bedroom looks exactly like peters, and that looks exactly like Ned. (Still think this is a shameless cash grab by Sony so that they can make Spider-Man worth even more before marvel buys him back fully, but I can appreciate that joke.)•ÈÀ"
TheCanineLady actually that‰Ûªs false. Ned was inspired by Miles‰Ûª friend Danke. Ned was based off miles morales.•ÈÀ

"Yeah, look at 1:33, that's the web of life and destiny and it has millions of lights. We'll probably see a lot more Spiders in the movie, maybe as a cameo but that's enough for me.•ÈÀ"
Hopefully he‰Ûªll make at least a cameo. I will be very disappointed if he doesn‰Ûªt show up at all. Same goes for black suit ultimate Spiderman•ÈÀ

Cool track man!•ÈÀ
thanks!•ÈÀ
What if in order to save everyone and get them back home peter sacrifices himself and the scene with miles at the Tombstone is the end•ÈÀ
"Loving the style so much. 3D CG space/models, 2D Comic Book texture/linework and Stop-Motion movement, flawless combination. And that bi-colour, 3D silhouette thing is giving me flashbacks to when that was what 3D looked like, when you wore paper glasses with a red and blue lens instead of plastic sunglasses, neat!Also pretty neat to finally have a Spidey film where Peter Parker's not the main character (Not counting Venom, since there's hardly any mention of Spider-man in it).I also like how this film takes ""Cinematic Universe"" literally, and brings all the movie-goers up to speed with some pretty signifcant bits of lore from the comics.Even if it never gets released or the film doesn't meet the hype of these awesome trailers; You've redeemed yourself from the Emoji Movie, Sony. You've actually expressed Passion, Innovation and Ambition in these trailers; and that's what the film industry needs way more of.•ÈÀ"

The like dislike ratio begs to differ with you•ÈÀ
About time Sony makes something worth watching. That Sherlock and Watson trailer for pure garbage•ÈÀ
"Tom HARDY as Spiderman's voice I mean #VENOM vs #SPIDERMAN•ÈÀ"

This is like the flash series but much better.•ÈÀ
The first few seconds of Spider-Man is a reference to Tobey Maguire!•ÈÀ
Noirrrr•ÈÀ
Gwen is hotter than I expected•ÈÀ
Sony better had paid Jordan for depicting his shoes _Ù÷_•ÈÀ
"""Do Animals talk in this dimension cause I don't wanna freak him out""•ÈÀ"
I have seen this kind a episode ... in Disney xd•ÈÀ
"I hope that they go all out with this dimension story and have 3 different spidermen voiced by Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland.•ÈÀ"
I hope for that same thing as well!•ÈÀ
omG YES•ÈÀ
"Leave Tom Holland out of it, MCU isn't ready yet for parallel universes.•ÈÀ"
Not going to happen•ÈÀ
"Patrick this isn‰Ûªt the MCU, he‰Ûªs just saying that it would be cool if the 3 actors made cameos in this film as different Spidermen from different dimensions•ÈÀ"
"The Peter parker in this movie seems to be the one from the raimi movies, he saved the Train in the same way, fighted doc oc, his only love was Mary Jane and saved her from a car at the restaurant•ÈÀ"
Exactly•ÈÀ
ABRAHAM ASCENCIO YESSSPLEASEEEE•ÈÀ

Super•ÈÀ
Real question is when is Vince gonna release the song that we all love from the first trailer.•ÈÀ
Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions•ÈÀ
"This looks good but heres the thing. Marvel CRUSHES IT in live action. But DC is 4 times better than marvel live action when it comes to animation. And that's not me exaggerating, go watch a dc animation. They are on another level. So marvel has a high bar to meet. And i just don't see this even coming near to DC's universe crossover Flashpoint.•ÈÀ"
Out of all the Spider-Men that I thought was going to be in this movie Spider-Ham was definitely not on my list but I'm glad he's in this movie regardless.•ÈÀ
*Spider-Pig•ÈÀ

The Spider-Man voice actor is so in-accurate. Anyone agree or is that just me.•ÈÀ
Better than captain marvel trailer. That's saying something!•ÈÀ
Oh man spidey noir??? I hope there‰Ûªs 2099 and Superior spidey with doc ock mind as well.•ÈÀ
Animation is look like Telltale's games•ÈÀ
This better live up to the hype.•ÈÀ
Why Spider-Man is black•ÈÀ

Uh?•ÈÀ
"Giving Gwen a haircut like that makes a lot of sense considering her hobbies.SPIDER NOIR!!!Oh and having the Japanese Spiderman be a girl also makes sense for this era.I don't think anyone would remember sentai styled shows. Plus might as well go all out eh?•ÈÀ"
"I think the little Japanese girl is meant to be Peni Parker? Only, you know, instead of a melancholic teenager with Daredevil as an uncle she seems to be basically a chibi?•ÈÀ"
This girl is reworked Peni Parker from SP//dr (spider verse)•ÈÀ
SP//dr (Peni Parker) is already a thing from the Edge of Spider-Verse comics.•ÈÀ
"Wait she's not the Sentai Spider with the mech?!RESEARCH AWAY!•ÈÀ"
"Huh, so its like Evangelion-esque before. A fine choice to make her a more optimistic and child character, just about everyone else is an adult or near it.Man I love these far alternate universe characters interacting, its like a sense of family and friends.•ÈÀ"
My boy the edgy spider from the past•ÈÀ
SHATRERD DEMENSIONS?????????•ÈÀ

How come there's no spiderman 2099•ÈÀ
And the last shot... spiderman in wakanda too ?•ÈÀ
At 1:39 you can see the insomniac suit!!!!!•ÈÀ
You got to love that noir Spider-Man has become such a character for everyone he is literally one of the starring Spider-men for the film•ÈÀ
"Frickin‰Ûª Spider-Ham is in this.This movie is gonna be amazing•ÈÀ"

Vikas Mandal Wait till Far From Home trailer drops.•ÈÀ
Kairos Cyril Milambiling did you see mysterio•ÈÀ
Yeah the leak ones.•ÈÀ
"Kairos Cyril Milambiling id rather see molten man or hydro man tbh, those two would be a lot more difficult to bring to into live action•ÈÀ"
@Kairos Cyril Milambiling not so mcu fan though•ÈÀ
@Brandon Walden Well MCU never failed to bring quality CGI character just like Thanos. The best CGI ever made in a character. Such details. Mysterio is also a character that you can't imagine in a live action especially with his fishbowl.•ÈÀ
Cant believe gwen stefani is a spider man•ÈÀ
Where‰Ûªs the ASIAN spooderman with Tiny Eyes?•ÈÀ
"What if Tom, Andrew and Toby shows up live action lol•ÈÀ"
Peni looks like she came straight out of some Anime dimension _Ù÷â•ÈÀ

"Did somebody see PS4 Spider-Man Suit on 1:38?Easter Eggs!•ÈÀ"

Remember... spiderman died on miles morales universe•ÈÀ
Thank god they still remember Tobey Maguire•ÈÀ
Where‰Ûªs 2099•ÈÀ
When is it going to be out?•ÈÀ
AAAWESOMEEEE!!!!•ÈÀ
loved that the Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is Tobey Maguire.•ÈÀ
that isn't Tobey's version. That train shot was just a reference•ÈÀ
He's not...•ÈÀ
It's Jake Johnson•ÈÀ
"The voice actor is Toby Macguire? I didn't recognize his voice, it's been some time so I hear him differently•ÈÀ"
Azad Pathak That‰Ûªs Jake Johnson from New Girl and Jurassic World•ÈÀ
Francisco Serrano the voice actor isn't Tobey.._Ù÷É•ÈÀ
Dude it definitely isn‰Ûªt•ÈÀ
@Francisco Serrano -_-•ÈÀ
Why you spreading fake news•ÈÀ
Is it really?•ÈÀ
"Francisco Serrano it‰Ûªs not him, they‰Ûªre just references•ÈÀ"
@Starcrap 64 Read nigga.... READ!!!•ÈÀ
"He really isn't though, it's just more of a really direct and on the nose reference to the movies.•ÈÀ"
its just a reference idiot•ÈÀ
"Obviously it's not Tobey's voice, but I was talking about the scenes shown are from trilogy starring Tobey Maguire.•ÈÀ"
I feel like it's definitely Sam Raimi Spidey and Jake Johnson is doing a Tobey Maguire impression•ÈÀ
I was wondering if the peter parker in this movie was the one from the movies based on those scenes with tobey maguire but that would be a pretty confusing thing to do•ÈÀ
"It never says it's Tobey's version, but they DEFINITELY want the audience to asume that (it has the train part, the kiss upside down, the clasic suit, the car almost hitting MJ while having a date) all of this scenes are shown on the Sam Raimi's trilogy.•ÈÀ"
No it's me•ÈÀ
@x destor also 2:01 looks like Kristen Dunst MJ for me•ÈÀ
@rockzs74r yes•ÈÀ
"0:14 Not him, Tobey‰Ûªs version doesn‰Ûªt use web shooters.•ÈÀ"
@NH808 Maybe Now He has started using them.•ÈÀ
"If Jake Johnson played a live action, older Spider-Man, I would be happy with that.•ÈÀ"
"So we‰Ûªve now gotSpider HamSpider Man NoireAnd... anime spider girl that I don‰Ûªt recognizeWhere‰Ûªs Spider-Man from the Japanese 70s TV show?•ÈÀ"
Black Spiderman•ÈÀ
You Deserve A Big ThumsUp ! Great Animation Film 2018•ÈÀ
I thought they changed the coke for copyright reasons...huh•ÈÀ
Is it me or they actually referenced Tobey's Spiderman .....?•ÈÀ
We got Easter eggs from tobey Maguires spider man series•ÈÀ
This will be a little better if i get to see spiderman 2099 in some way•ÈÀ

Good! maybe they wont feel the need to blackwash Spiderman in the main films. Although you can see the intent to show that Spiderman can be any race or gender. If thats the case then so can wonder woman and black panther...•ÈÀ
_Ù÷Õ......ok•ÈÀ
Did Spider-Man just punch a car?? Man wtf•ÈÀ
Those references to the Holy Trilogy were fantastic. Should've cast Tobey Maguire to voice Peter in this. It would have been really cool for the older fans!•ÈÀ

Spider-Ham > anime Spiderloli•ÈÀ
"Oh boy yeah - Tobey ""Spiderman"" Maguire•ÈÀ"
"One word, dope!•ÈÀ"

"rdkns  calm down no need to break your caps button•ÈÀ"
Could it be? A GOOD Spider-Man movie? From SONY? After so long?•ÈÀ
0:21 The fact that Yugo still exsists in this universe makes me happy•ÈÀ
Who cares?•ÈÀ
You do. That‰Ûªs why you clicked on the video.•ÈÀ
This better become a series or at least have a sequel.•ÈÀ

Ville Lepoaho This is a comic book character. Anything is possible in comic books.•ÈÀ
Have you seen spiderman?•ÈÀ
Spiderman knocked out a t rex with one punch before.•ÈÀ
The thing about Marvel is that all the heroes are claimed to be potentially infinitely powerful•ÈÀ
"it's the original Spider-Man from the canonalso Spider-Man can lift the daily bugle•ÈÀ"
Spiderman hit a chick with a brick and killed her.. Wolverine's chick•ÈÀ
"Spider man is Insanely Strong, if he  wanted to kill you with a punch you would die. Hes lifted thousands of tons. he can easily stop a car coming at him at full speed•ÈÀ"
You CLEARLY are new to Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
"He meant that his is fist should have sinked into the body of the car and stop it, not reject it•ÈÀ"
Depends on a few things. Just like a Bullet it can pierce the target and also knock it backwards•ÈÀ
Wow.•ÈÀ
"Spider-ham, Spider-ham, does whatever a piggy canOinks a sound very loud, covered with all the mud,Look out, here comes the Spider-ham!•ÈÀ"

Love it that they paid a tribute to Raimi's Spiderman films as well. The train and the kiss with MJ.•ÈÀ
This ought to be good. Hopefully it won‰Ûªt be a disaster like the Emoji Movie.•ÈÀ
"What..what makes u different what makes u spiderman. Dude u r not different. There so many of us,  spiderman•ÈÀ"

Hmmmm... the Capt. Marvel trailer was more like a teaser I think.•ÈÀ
"Ppl are saying that the trailer for cap Marvel was made that way(plain) so that the viewers will get the wrong impression Not sure what Marvel is planning showing that kind of trailer but still gonna watch it in order to know more about Infinity War 2.•ÈÀ"

"Spiderman turns into black latino._ÙÔÎ_Ù÷ see you at the cinema+ we need equality so we need a spidergirl too•ÈÀ"

"This just got a whole lot more interesting. Throwing in Noir, Ham, AND Gwen? We've got a whole Spider-Verse reunion going on.•ÈÀ"
Why is there a spider pig?!!??? I get it‰Ûªs an animation but still that‰Ûªs stupid for a marvel film•ÈÀ

"I LOVE IT but at the same time I can't help but wonder: I know all of these spideys but what would a casual think of this? I mean not everyone knows Spider Gwen or Ham. Would they just get weirded out (Especially with the Homecoming-movie-knowledge)  or are they with us, excited?•ÈÀ"
"Mr. Stark, I feel pretty fucking good•ÈÀ"
"Why is it glitching  so mutch Stop motion ?Bad videoIs my phone tripping•ÈÀ"
Anyone that wants to watch this isn't a spider-man fan.•ÈÀ

"Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy and literally a hundred people: "" Yeah? Get in line.""•ÈÀ"
Awesomeeeeee•ÈÀ
So.....is no one gonna talk about Spider-Man PUNCHING AWAY A CAR?•ÈÀ
I sell tickets for the Hype train. Ya' ridin'?•ÈÀ
Couldn't they made it with more FPS?•ÈÀ
Not good animation•ÈÀ
"Just FYI for the non-comic book readers: It‰Ûªs SPIDER-HAM (Peter Porker), not Spider-Pig. He‰Ûªs not from ‰ÛÏThe Simpsons Movie‰Û, he‰Ûªs an actually Marvel character that‰Ûªs been around since the 80s. Just wanted to clear that up.•ÈÀ"
Do animals talk in this dimension? Cuz  I don't want to freak him out._Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
Spidernigger•ÈÀ
The story sounds a lil' like the game•ÈÀ
Bangam•ÈÀ
Animals do talk•ÈÀ

That's SP//dr (Peni Parker). Shes inspired by Evangelion•ÈÀ
Is no one gonna point out how dope the thumbnail is?•ÈÀ
1:35 Never thought Spider-man Noir would work with Nice Cage's voice.•ÈÀ
Tag yourself. I'm the guy who fainted.•ÈÀ

Terrence Griffin even better an animated spider-multiverse•ÈÀ
MY MAAAAAAAAAAAAAN•ÈÀ
"Sooo can we expect Tobey,Adrew and Tom in the MCU Multiverse?•ÈÀ"
Did not care nearly as much about this movie as I do now.•ÈÀ
"The Sync1.Stopping the train2.Punching the car3.Disney XD series•ÈÀ"
Peter Parker looks like a hobo•ÈÀ
Waiting for a Chinese Spiderman than Indian Spiderman than a Hispanic Spiderman than an Arab Spiderman (who will blow up everything and will bring an end to the entire franchise)•ÈÀ
And when they just said DC are ahead of Marvel in animation....•ÈÀ
THE SAM RAIMI REFERENCES!!!!!!! im so here for this•ÈÀ

This year has been all about Spiderman•ÈÀ
Hype is real. Big fan. Especially right after the game!•ÈÀ
I absolutely LOVE John Mulaney as Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
I'm not even a huge Spider-man fan but this seems great•ÈÀ
Who read the spider verse comics? Cus I wanna see toei Spider-Man•ÈÀ

@ 2:28 is that wakanda?!•ÈÀ
I want to see Spiderman 2099 but the noire is cool to•ÈÀ
don't give away too much now•ÈÀ
Is that the Sam Rami Trilogy Spider-Man?•ÈÀ
"Am I the only one who feels like PS4's Spiderman game is a prequel to this movie? It has Miles in it, closely working with Peter, and it also shows him becoming spiderman at the end! And Peter is always looking out for him in the game, and now we have him mentoring him here!•ÈÀ"
Looks boring asf  . Expanding the Venomverse is where its at .•ÈÀ
Wow•ÈÀ
"2:29Isnt that from Black Panther?•ÈÀ"

"Dear Sony, please don't jack and Jill this.•ÈÀ"
"This is handsdown my favorite trailer, and I am so hyped.•ÈÀ"
God dang this looks amazing!•ÈÀ
"They should‰Ûªve got Tobey Maguire to voice Peter Parker and have this Spider-Man be the same one from those movies with the same suit and everything just 10 or 20 years in the future, especially with all those references to those movies at the beginning of the trailer.•ÈÀ"
you know what suit Peter should wear? The Advance Suit•ÈÀ
"Would have been cool to see that, they could have also revisited some of the villains he faced in the trilogy.•ÈÀ"
1:39 spiderman ps4 suit left container behind aunt may•ÈÀ

"I mean, you had me at Spider-ham! But did anybody else notice all the Raimi movie references? Heck that photo of Mary Jane even looks like Kirsten Dunst! This movie is shaping up to be one of the most spectacular takes on Spider-Man since Spider-Man 2!•ÈÀ"

WHERE. IS. MORLUN?????   I want to see the inheritors of reality hunt the spidermen down....•ÈÀ
"Wasted opportunity, yet we have to see Kingpin and Green Goblin again who are pretty underwhelming for a story like this.•ÈÀ"
"@Patrick yeah we could have had at last a villain that was an actual menace to all of the spiders....   but no, we get an half assed story about dimensions colliding instead of an epic story about an army of spidermen duking it out with their greatest threat. BTW Spider-geddon looks like it'll be about the inheritors breaking out of their prison planet•ÈÀ"
"@Grahald Mills Can't wait for Spider-geddon, want to see Spider-man PS4 in action and the return of Spider-man Noir and 2099.•ÈÀ"
"Spiderman (Peter Parker) being like "" Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good""•ÈÀ"

Well there's no spider man 2099 that's a deal breaker for me.•ÈÀ
"Spider-pig spider-pigDoes whatever a spider-pig does Can he swing from a web!?No he can't! He's a pig!Look out! Here comes the spider-pig!•ÈÀ"
His name is spider-ham  not spider-pig you duffer•ÈÀ
Peter Porker can do anything that spider can do because he is the Spectacular Spider-Ham!•ÈÀ
He's referencing Simpsons. :)•ÈÀ
ohh I know...seen the film•ÈÀ
Spider-Man Noir!!!•ÈÀ
miles got bitten by a spider one the game on ps4.•ÈÀ
Okay... so this is super disappointing.... what's with the spiderpig? Is this a simpsons reference or something•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham was created by Marvel in like... the 80s as a parody•ÈÀ
That‰Ûªs spider ham and he‰Ûªs been a thing since the 80‰Ûªs•ÈÀ
Mind blown. I have got none spared! December come sooner.•ÈÀ
Spider Loli!•ÈÀ
"What song is in this trailer, i loved that track!•ÈÀ"

spider-verse isn't a simple story at all•ÈÀ
_Ù÷â_Ù_£_Ù÷â_Ù_£ this looks great•ÈÀ
Bruh this background music is straight FIRE•ÈÀ

I haven't been more excited for a movie in a LONG time. This looks top-notch!•ÈÀ
H Y P E•ÈÀ
"This trailer looks hella fun_Ù÷_Ù_© but I'll wait for the movie to come out. Also, those saying venom is trash are seriously blind or trying appear as smart 'cuz I saw seven tweets and only one was purely negative while rest were mixed reviews that can be categorized as constructive criticism. So don't let some dipshit's trolling decide what's your opinion gonna be and if you don't wanna watch the movie or can't go because of some reason, please don't be a jerk to the movie.•ÈÀ"
here before trending :)•ÈÀ
What if we get suits in Spider-Man PS4 inspired by this movie•ÈÀ

"Hype 4 me...SPIDER-GWEN!! PUNK GWEN!!!!!Like if u agree•ÈÀ"
"Wow this was actually a really good trailer, instantly got me hooked on it and i'm not really a spiderman fan. I do like hearing about the multiverse in marvel though and it's cool that studious are finally comfortable with that weird part of comic books to make a movie out of it.•ÈÀ"

"I love this. Noir looks amazing, i can only hope there'll be a moment at the end where we see all the other universes, at least like for a momentary thing, so that Leopardon, Silk, Spider woman, Superior, 2099, and all the others can get at least the smallest of cameos•ÈÀ"
This reminds me of The Flash series•ÈÀ
WTF•ÈÀ
I'm so here for this!  I wish it was three hours long.•ÈÀ
Just _ÙÓ´•ÈÀ
This trailer...it made me smile :)•ÈÀ
Sony > Disney•ÈÀ
SPIDER NOIR!!!•ÈÀ
I saw this movie has 2d animated series in Disney XD•ÈÀ
"Ok alexa, now this is epic•ÈÀ"
My body is ready•ÈÀ
"I don't love the animation style, but I do love the Raimi Spidey callbacks.•ÈÀ"
Spider man Noir and Spider Gwen needs a solo movie•ÈÀ
"Ok, but where's Spider-Man 2099 tho?•ÈÀ"
I've been a spiderman fan since i learn how to talk•ÈÀ
"This can literally not get any weirder?I tell you what's weirder : Teen Titans Go to the Movies that's weird _Ù÷Á_Ù÷Á•ÈÀ"
0:10 woah is this canon to the Sam Raimi‰Ûªs trilogy??•ÈÀ
"Not gonna lie, not keen on Gwen's hair. And now the ballerina shoes REALLY don't suit her.•ÈÀ"
Spidy into spidy verse•ÈÀ
Wait so was that spider pig??•ÈÀ
Coach Hybrid no that‰Ûªs Peter Porker from the comics•ÈÀ
Almighty god nope it‰Ûªs spider-pig from the Simpsons movie•ÈÀ
_Ù¤•ÈÀ
OMG_Ù÷_Ù÷Á_Ù÷Á_Ù÷Á_Ù÷Á_Ù÷Á_Ù÷ÁHOW MUSH SPIDER MAN ON THE WORLD•ÈÀ
"""Do animals talk in this dimension cause I don't wanna freak him out"" lol•ÈÀ"
What a good day to be alive.•ÈÀ
No 2099?•ÈÀ
There was an episode on animated series of Spider-Man... where all these spidy ppl appears in that episode. Including ham spidy•ÈÀ
Gwen Stacy looks so amazing!•ÈÀ
cringe•ÈÀ
">Gwen stacyHow much do you want to bet they'll leave out peters PTSD•ÈÀ"
Spider-Ham is best•ÈÀ
Cool trailer man•ÈÀ
Black spiderman_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â.. I guess they don't like black panther _Ù_£_Ù_£•ÈÀ
Who‰Ûªs this Anime Girl? All I want is LEOPARDON!•ÈÀ
That's Peni Parker.•ÈÀ
"Ian Greene But she‰Ûªs not Supaidaman•ÈÀ"
But SP//DR is great too•ÈÀ
She‰Ûªs from a universe where all the superhero stuff is also giant robot and monster stuff.•ÈÀ
"No, Leopardon belongs to super sentai Spider-Man, aka the first live action Japanese Spider-Man, that is Peni Parker she is one of the anime inspired Spider-Men, specifically base on the anime Evangelion•ÈÀ"
"Peni parker, her father is peter parkerHer father left the robot thing(in the comic book is the giant spider armor SP//DR She is the only one that can use that armor or robot•ÈÀ"
@VenomIsSoCute I would love Supaidaman to be in this•ÈÀ
More like he died in the SP//DR suit and Peni was the one chosen to use it and she had to get bit by the radioactive spider that bit Peter•ÈÀ
A spider bit me just right now. _ÙÔ•ÈÀ
SPIDER-HAM!!! I'M SOLD!•ÈÀ
where's 2099 at?•ÈÀ
"So i think i get itSo spidey fall into a other universe where he died  or you can call it ultimate universe that other spider people pops intoI think•ÈÀ"
They added the Sam Raimi Spiderman parts!•ÈÀ
Lmao that Spider-ham part•ÈÀ
Is that... Spider-Pig? From like The Simpsons movie?•ÈÀ
"It's Spider Ham, from the Spider Ham comics. Though it was probably inspired to begin with by the Simpsons•ÈÀ"
"When I say penis You say perker•ÈÀ"
Who‰Ûªs hyped for venom and this?•ÈÀ
"Mr. Stark, WE dont feel so good.•ÈÀ"
Last action hero?•ÈÀ
This animation is incredible•ÈÀ
Aw c‰Ûªmon where‰Ûªs 2099?•ÈÀ
That buttery smooth 15 fps tho....•ÈÀ
ikr looks like a google slides presentation•ÈÀ
"I'm just happy they fixed the flow of the animation. Compared to the first trailer (which looked blocky), this looks and feels amazing.•ÈÀ"
@Aram R/A agreed.•ÈÀ
"It has a purpose. I believe this technique is ""animating on twos"". It's used here to create the illusion of a moving comic book, with the choppy animation sort of mimicking how you would switch between comic panels. The comic effect is even more apparent when you notice the halftone filters in most of the shots.•ÈÀ"
Welp its that time of the year again where our wallets suddenly get empty.•ÈÀ
SpiderPig voiced by the same guy from BigMouth's Andrew Globerman?•ÈÀ
"Love it or hate it, I'm pissed we never got to finish that cliffhanger of an ending in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.Could you imagine Lord of the Rings having no part 3?•ÈÀ"
"Enjoy it while you can , Holland•ÈÀ"
Why is this made in 15fps?_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
I hope they make love action spider verse movie one day•ÈÀ
Is this in the Sam Raimi Spiderman universe or were those just some little Easter egg/homages in the beginning?•ÈÀ
Probably homages to it.•ÈÀ
ThEy MaDe SiMpSonS a ReAl ThIng -said every idiot who thought Simpsons created Spider-Ham first...did they? I forgot.•ÈÀ
Wtf he's black•ÈÀ
"Who loves Peter Parker.. Hit likes for Peter Parker..•ÈÀ"
Never liked spider verse...•ÈÀ
"ok so Miles Spiderman Peter SpidermanGwen Spiderwoman/girlRandom Bot SpiderBot Anime Girl Spidergirl/woman?Pig Spiderpig Stealth Spiderman All in one•ÈÀ"
"Anime Girl: SP//dr a.ka Peni Parker, Peter's adopted Japanese cousin•ÈÀ"
"Before:I am not that exited for the movie.Sees Spider-HamI AM DEFINITELY WATCHING THIS NOW!!!•ÈÀ"
Sony gonna rock this time!!!!•ÈÀ
I'd love to of seen spider-man 2099 but we'd be asking too much at this point.•ÈÀ
Spider Man Zabra Fan xdd•ÈÀ

"I think this is the anvanced sam raimi‰Ûªs spiderman but in cartoon, I really love it•ÈÀ"

When the screen is so wide and doesn't have the same height as a normal video I feel like the top part of the screen is being cut off and it really pisses me off :(•ÈÀ
"Angus Fraser Yes that IS how movies work•ÈÀ"

Please tell me this version of Peter didn't do One More Day.•ÈÀ
"This should have been the first trailer. No political agenda present, just a trailer for the film.•ÈÀ"
"Jamie Holt There was no political agenda in the first trailer?This trailer also had to come AFTER Comic-con•ÈÀ"
"@VenomIsSoCuteThe first trailer I watched, Miles being black was a focal point of the video.•ÈÀ"

"Why the video looks like low framerate, Lower than cinematic 24fps•ÈÀ"

"xavierrobinson55 Technically her name is Spider-Woman, but fans know her as Spider-Gwen.•ÈÀ"
She literally says her name in the trailer•ÈÀ
"@Ren Davis, that's because Spider-Woman is Jessica Drew, so to not confuse the two. Marvel announced her as Spider-Gwen, but in the comics (to ordinary people) she's called ""....""•ÈÀ"
@Ren Davis Spider-Woman is another character entirely•ÈÀ
"xavierrobinson55 Yeah I understand that. I‰Ûªm just saying that technically her name is Spider-Woman. I‰Ûªm not saying I have a problem with Spider-Gwen, but just stating her in universe name.•ÈÀ"

Be Greater.•ÈÀ
"I thought I was hyped before, THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE DOPE AF!!!•ÈÀ"

Spider-Man PS4 suit behind of Aunt May 1:38•ÈÀ
I think the movie looks good but Miles‰Ûªs voice is a little iffy.•ÈÀ
El fuc$ing cool•ÈÀ
Will it comes on Xbox one and PC_Ù÷ã_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
This looks wack. The animation is unbearable.•ÈÀ
Nick was secretly Spider-Man all along•ÈÀ
SPIDER-PIG!!!•ÈÀ
Fun Fact about the movie: Spider-Man Noir is voiced by Nick Cage•ÈÀ
This animation is insane. Would love to see it being made or animated•ÈÀ
I hope sony make live action spiderman miles version_Ù÷•ÈÀ
Shut up is the worst version•ÈÀ
Miles is great Kevin shut up LOL•ÈÀ
Some one rasis  heir!!•ÈÀ
Sony has proven with the amazing spiderman that they are not to be trusted. Homecoming was only decent because marvel studios already created the character for them.•ÈÀ
"Not sony, marvel will be better•ÈÀ"
Why does it look like it's in 20fps throughout the whole movie?•ÈÀ
Its supposed to take the effect of a comic book.•ÈÀ
WTF ? Is this in the Tobey Universe?•ÈÀ
Also like the spider version of big hero. _Ù÷  I assume this is a comic? If is what's it called?•ÈÀ
Looks like Spider-Gwen is having a bad hair day.•ÈÀ
Dad I Love You!!!!•ÈÀ
just me who is planning to watch it on release date?!•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham!!!•ÈÀ
OH ITS LIT LIT!!•ÈÀ
Black Panther reference at the end???•ÈÀ
No those things are actually in NYC•ÈÀ
"I think that was supposed to be Prowler, who has a more personal connection to Miles Morales.Edit: Oh, you were talking about the statue.•ÈÀ"
"Explicitly Censored nope, is same spot in beggining of trailer•ÈÀ"
@JTR prowler is his uncle•ÈÀ
"@M Bintang I am aware, I just did not want to reveal potential spoilers for those who did not know.•ÈÀ"
_ÙÕø_ÙÕø_ÙÕø_ÙÕø•ÈÀ
NOW THATS AN ANIMATION!!•ÈÀ
How do I like twice?•ÈÀ
I still can't believe a movie like this is happening. I've never been this excited for a film before!!!•ÈÀ
is it me or Sony's movies have obnoxiously big noticable product placement? i usually dont really notice it but with Sony.. it just so obvious•ÈÀ
Who's the Japanese girl? Where's the Siege Perilous?•ÈÀ
SUPAIDAMAN .•ÈÀ
"Peni Parker, aka Sp//dr•ÈÀ"
@Miftahul Fath if only•ÈÀ
He did not just punch a car....•ÈÀ
Wait. So I‰Ûªm confused. Are Peter and Miles in the same universe or not?•ÈÀ
Black peter parker? really?•ÈÀ
Peter Parker is white. This is miles Morales.•ÈÀ
Was that the bloody noir Spider-Man?•ÈÀ
A los que son espaÌ±oles lo tengo en mi canal en espaÌ±ol saludos•ÈÀ
Noir Spidey looks sweet with that trench coat and fedora.•ÈÀ
So many spiders in my computer?!?•ÈÀ

Awesome!•ÈÀ
It's amzaing dude_Ù÷±_Ù÷±_Ù÷±•ÈÀ
Dead. This is too amazing for me _ÙÓ´‰_•ü•ÈÀ
Every version of Spiderman have a secret except the spider ham•ÈÀ
I saw the Advanced Suit•ÈÀ
"Ok, I knew Peter, Miles, Gwen, Nicholas Cage and Peter Porker. Who's the Japanese one??•ÈÀ"
"By the looks of it, i'm guessing it's a version of SpiderMan who uses a mech-suit•ÈÀ"
"@H the Warrior Yes, it's Spiderman Robotech•ÈÀ"
"@H the Warrior No wait wait wait...It's Spider-Man Neo Genesis Evangelion.•ÈÀ"
Lautaro Omar Lamalfa I think you mean SpiderMan Gundam•ÈÀ
"@H the Warrior You're right, I've actually never watched that series•ÈÀ"
Me neither•ÈÀ
But then again it could be SpiderMan PowerRanger•ÈÀ
"@H the Warrior Well, after searching deeply through the dark web (and by that I mean finding a tweet with a clue on where to start searching) she's called Peni Parker and the suit IS a reference to NGE.•ÈÀ"
"Thanks mate, didn't know that•ÈÀ"
Less tragic than Spider man PS4•ÈÀ
Why is everyone black lol•ÈÀ
"......too many characters.Ehhh......* shrugs shoulders *•ÈÀ"
"Literally a spiderpigHAHA•ÈÀ"
Omg stop showing parts of the trailer before the trailer Sony•ÈÀ
for some reason every company does this•ÈÀ
It's made for YouTube so you see what the trailer is for before the Skip Ad button comes up•ÈÀ
Ashton Brewer It‰Ûªs actually kind of clever•ÈÀ
"omg, this is a dream come true•ÈÀ"
I'm so glad this is animated and that they are really taking advantage of the tools at their disposal. Maybe we can get more animated action films if this goes well.•ÈÀ
Nicholas Cage is voicing Spider Man Noir?!•ÈÀ

"1:36 Is that the anime version of Spiderman!!!????I've got a feeling that I'm gonna love this  movie!•ÈÀ"
That's SUPAIDAMAN from Japan. (Comic version) like Batman ninja•ÈÀ

"Saw at least 3 Sam Raimi Spiderman references in there. Very nice touch. I'm starting to like the stop motion-esque animation style more and more too, not to mention the incredible comic pop art visuals. What a year to be a Spiderman fan :D•ÈÀ"
"I know the story because of the cartoons.(am I weird)Edit:There were a lot of mistakes•ÈÀ"
This is SPIDER-TASTIC•ÈÀ
"0:01 Tombstone in the bottom left ALSOA shame they didn't add Spider-Man 2099, but I'm also happy they added Noir.also, you can see Spider-Man PS4's Advanced Suit in the background of 1:39I honestly can't wait for the movie, 10/10•ÈÀ"
"Maybe they'll add him, they just didn't show him in the trailer or he could cameo.•ÈÀ"
"Cancer UYE I wanted to see Superior, but that would be too much.•ÈÀ"
@Mister Puns and Scarlet and Kaine and May and Benji and Spider-Punk and Spider-UK and Cosmic Spiderman!•ÈÀ

Wow its just like the spiderman animated series where goblin tries to take all the spiderman blood•ÈÀ
"With great powersComes new spider ManAnd also with great responsibility _Ù÷É•ÈÀ"
"Marvel are releasing alot of movies that DC in my opinion can't compare but as years go by, DC will possibly beat Marvel. DC and Marvel both have their pros and cons•ÈÀ"
"Probably, a while back, DC movies were WAY better than any Marvel movie•ÈÀ"
@H the Warrior Can agree 100%•ÈÀ
"I'm  am so exited•ÈÀ"
Where did the anime girl come from? _Ù÷¦•ÈÀ
After all the years of people asking for a black spider man we got one•ÈÀ
Clips Central Miles Morales was a thing since 2011 though so he isn‰Ûªt new lol•ÈÀ
This is how to make Spider-Man bad•ÈÀ
"Nope, this is how to make it great•ÈÀ"
"1:39 Insomniac Spider-Man behind the old woman‰Ûªs left shoulder, I assume she‰Ûªs either Aunt May or Madame Web.•ÈÀ"

Ughhh that looks yummy•ÈÀ
"1:35 Great to hear your voice again, Mr Cage•ÈÀ"

sony might finally get it right this time•ÈÀ
The coolest movie ive ever seen.•ÈÀ
This trailer is good and all but.....where is my boy Miguel?•ÈÀ
I love this soo much!•ÈÀ
"I love how all of the situations Peter is shown in is a reference to the Tobey Maguire/Sam Raimi Spider-Man. He did the stopping the train, upside down kiss with MJ, and having a date with MJ and a car being tossed to his back. Only in this version he turns around and punches the car.•ÈÀ"
Yep definitely Toby's SpiderMan•ÈÀ
Love that Sami Raimi Spiderman reference at 0.12•ÈÀ
And the Insomniac suit at 1:39 behind aunt may•ÈÀ
It's looks insane...I can't wait ^^•ÈÀ

ye to dhamaka hai spiderman ka•ÈÀ
What's sad is that more effort was put into this than the Venom movie. And I'm okay with that.•ÈÀ

"Okay, now this is E_ÙÉ±•üic•ÈÀ"
"The fact that this is made by Sony Animation makes me lose my hope. But let's see if it's good. Homecoming was painfully average,so I guess I'm hoping for this to fix that.•ÈÀ"
Guess this Peter Parker didn't have a Gwen Stacy in his universe to die on him.•ÈÀ

"Seeing Raimi references""Sony was a hero...I just couldn't see it.""•ÈÀ"
"I hope they do what they did in the Spiderverse comic, make a reference to seeing Spider-Men that look like the guy from Seabiscuit and The Social Network.•ÈÀ"
"Oh sh*t, this one is super cool, but this trailer revealed too much of the STORY. It would have been great if some things remained hidden.•ÈÀ"
With great thoterry comes a greater peace.•ÈÀ
Pete sounds like Fe4RLess•ÈÀ
i dont feel so good•ÈÀ
I like the throwback references but you should have used Tobey as the voice actor instead of some guy that sounds like a pothead. Doesn‰Ûªt fit the character at all.•ÈÀ
Super hero•ÈÀ
Like the sam raimi refferences.•ÈÀ
"YEAR OF MARVEL. Better, YEAR OF SPIDERMAN. ( Tom Holland in infinity war, hardy in venom, then these guys...... TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. SPIDERFANS , brace urselves. _Ù÷_•ÈÀ"

Now Spidey has waifus on his movie. I'm interested in such a wrong way. It looks great af too. I hope our hero SUPAIDAMAN makes a cameo at least.•ÈÀ
"The inverted kissThe train stoppingThe car fly into dinerYup, I see you there Tobey•ÈÀ"
...Are you implying this is the  Spidey from the Sam Raimi films?•ÈÀ
Manuel Alberto Romero no it‰Ûªs just references to those movies•ÈÀ
Oh Boy Yeah•ÈÀ
"The train is as canon as it gets, where ever peter is there.•ÈÀ"
@Manuel Alberto Romero I mean he even do the naration from Sam Raimi Spiderman•ÈÀ
Well... this movie bascily says that there are many universes with different people. This means that all spider-man movies are in a away Canon. Well all of them atleast in different universes.•ÈÀ
I think it's not meant to be him but still a Peter with a very similar trajectory to the Sam Raimi films.•ÈÀ
Funny you say that. The brazillan voice actor for Peter its the same for Tobey.•ÈÀ
"I think it is the same but also not the same as he has the mask on during the train scene and the entire suit during the dinner scene. So a different timeline where similar stuff happens, but not exactly the same universe as those movies.•ÈÀ"
"Every Spider-Man is canon. They all exist in different universes. Raimi Spider-Man, 60s cartoon Spider-Man (he even cameos in a Spider-Verse comic), MCU Spider-Man, Insomniac's PS4 Spider-Man, all canon.•ÈÀ"
Best spidey is tobey•ÈÀ
And yet they miss the chance to bring him back.•ÈÀ

"+Polkadi, and Webb's Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"

And yes, I'm aware that they were trying to compete with Disney & Pixar from the beginning and that they already had Shrek 1 to their name.)•ÈÀ"
what do you mean?•ÈÀ
I...I genuinely can't tell if this is supposed to be a compliment or insult.•ÈÀ
@Brian Fitzsimmons Kung Fu Panda is fantastic so... A complement?•ÈÀ
The best u can expect from a studio who makes slender man and emoji movie is an barely average movie•ÈÀ

"That will be be super dope if it was Spider-Man 4, Sam Raimi trilogy are live action and this one is animated•ÈÀ"
"It is similar but not the same as he has the mask on during the train scene, and during the dinner with MJ he has the entire suit on. And as others have stated, he does not shoot webs out of his body. So a universe where a lot of the same stuff happened but still not exactly like it. Probably just added as sort of an homage to the Reimi trilogy.•ÈÀ"
ThePumaoX You can see the Insomniac‰Ûªs Spidey PS4 suit in this trailer. It‰Ûªs at 1:39-1:40.•ÈÀ
"@inusha De Silva , yeah, that button is for the web shooters at his wrist, and the wrist is not drawn in that photo so its probably to save time on animating.•ÈÀ"

Well this actully looks good . And yes you can take in association with Marvel very serious . Originaly Sony did have not the rights to use Miles Morales or spider-Gwen . But thanks to their sharing deal with Marvel . That allows spider-man to appear in Mcu . And sony‰Ûªs spider-man movies with Tom Holland to be set in the mcu (I loved spider-man homecoming and I am gonna love Spider-man far from home) This beautiful animated movie is here.. I am gonna see this ...•ÈÀ

"For a moment I thought they made spiderman african-american to look 2k18 u know as all movies do nowadays with famous white characters, but then I realised it's an alternate universe where the spiderman is african-american and in another universe the ""real"" one exists, yadda yadda, point said, excited for it, good job.•ÈÀ"
"Maddie, will you marry me!•ÈÀ"
Hell yeah they have noir Spiderman•ÈÀ

whats the name of the song playing in the background ?•ÈÀ
"There have been many AMAZING Spider-Man movies but this might be SUPERIOR to all. The animation style is SPECTACULAR and I love that the movie is using the ULTIMATE universe version of Spider-Man. I know the jokes are bad but can we get 2099 likes? Or maybe UNLIMITED likes?•ÈÀ"
Dang•ÈÀ
theres only one spiderman in the universe PETER PARKER•ÈÀ
"God, this is better than anything I've seen.•ÈÀ"
"Can't wait for that Christmas Album! With great hits like Peter the Red and Blue Spider, Jingle Web Rock and Uncle Ben Got Shot Down by a Mugger!•ÈÀ"
And I dont feel so good•ÈÀ

"PIZZA TIME, A**SSHOLES!•ÈÀ"

Do animals talk in this dimension I don't want to fear him out•ÈÀ
Amazing background music•ÈÀ
"Looking Good. I just hope that if this is as good as it looks and does well, that we get a full fledged Spiderman Noir Movie. The Noir Universe deserves way more attention and Stories.•ÈÀ"
I wish they show the noir universe in the MCU•ÈÀ
"Ranger Talion There‰Ûªs likely no chance that the MCU is going to go into more depth about the spider verse, but It‰Ûªd be really cool if there were more spiderman movies based on the alternate universes.•ÈÀ"
The art style of a noir universe spiderman movie would be amazing•ÈÀ
The animation is amazing!!! I am shitting my pants!•ÈÀ
2:26 Black Panther?•ÈÀ
They all dont feel so good•ÈÀ
"Cooked up prefect Waiting to be served _Ù÷•ÈÀ"

Finally we get Scorpion in a Spider-Man movie.•ÈÀ
Peter Parker looks like Jake Gyllenhaal_Ù_Ó•ÈÀ
Did they just do a homage of Spider-Man 2•ÈÀ
Gwen looks sexy af•ÈÀ
If noir doesn't kick spider-ham I am gonna be a little disappointed.•ÈÀ
Oh shet! Is this Spider-Man actually the same guy that Tobey potrayed??•ÈÀ
no thanks. Stop forcing your bullshit PC agenda into things that don't need it.•ÈÀ
Why it seem like 30 FPS•ÈÀ
I feel they tell the whole story in this trailer _Ù_Ó•ÈÀ
NYC•ÈÀ
When spiderman ps4 has better video graphics than the spider verse!!!The movie is gonna be great tho•ÈÀ
"The graphics aren't worse. The art style is different, that's all.•ÈÀ"
@someone i didnt say its bad but im just one of those minorities who prefer simple video graphics thats all..but the sam raimi references in the movie are on point•ÈÀ
where's my boy spider-man 2099 at?•ÈÀ
Holy crap are you me? I was thinking the same thing in the exact same words as I scrolled down to the comment section.•ÈÀ
Yeah I was hoping they'd tease him at the very end.•ÈÀ
lmao I was like they've added noir and spider-ham why not 2099•ÈÀ
They give us Peni Parker but not Miguel.....•ÈÀ
different universe not different timeline i guess...•ÈÀ
"this is different universes, not different times. spiderman 2099 is in the future, not a diff universe•ÈÀ"
"Just wait at 2099, 22 years after 2077!•ÈÀ"
Spiderman 2099 will be in this movie. Cause its like the spiderman animated series where goblin tries to take all dimension  spiderman blood•ÈÀ
Trollest troll because they were like we already got miles in there and that‰Ûªs already one too many minorities smh _Ù__‰Û‰ªÛ•ü•ÈÀ
@Abhiram Menon Yes and no.•ÈÀ
They has to save something for end..._Ù÷ä_Ù÷ä•ÈÀ
Spiderman 2099 is earth-298 being different from the main universe which is earth-616•ÈÀ
2099 i guess•ÈÀ
well I guess they cant show every thing in the trailer right? gotta save my boy Miguel for last.•ÈÀ
my bad is 928 lol•ÈÀ
"@Abhiram Menon someone never read ""Spider-Verse""....    and yeah 2099 IS another dimension in the marvel universe....   in fact it's missing a few interesting spiders. Spider Punk, Kaine, Superior SpiderMan, Silk, May Parker and many more but more importantly Morlun and the Inheritors of Reality•ÈÀ"
@Thrll ZcK 2099 is not timeline it's different universe man.•ÈÀ
"Trollest troll Miguel O'hara I don't know•ÈÀ"
I know right what the shock Sony XD•ÈÀ
@Sebastian Maregatti smh•ÈÀ
You ok? Spiderman 2099 is from the future not from another universe. get your facts right lol•ÈÀ
"Thrll ZcK YOU get your facts straights,Miguel is both from the future and another dimension•ÈÀ"
Da ComicBookNerd I understood that reference•ÈÀ
Yep but we're referring to *616 Spiderman 2099*...so...•ÈÀ
What's the song playing in this?•ÈÀ
"Don't know the exact song, but the songs playing in this trailer as well as the songs in the first two trailers are all original songs that will be on the soundtrack for this movie that comes out in December•ÈÀ"
oook thank you!•ÈÀ
"I think 1 of the songs in the trailer is called ""Outasight""åÊby The Boogie. The other one at the beginning is a soundtrack song.•ÈÀ"
Ps4 Spiderman game has better graphic than this_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
Awesome!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
Omg.•ÈÀ
"Your friendly neibourhood spider MAN, BOY & LADY......•ÈÀ"
Spider-people*•ÈÀ

DID YOU JUST ASSUME THIER GENDERS?!•ÈÀ
GREATEST TIME TO BE A SPIDER-MAN FAN FIRST SPIDER-MAN PS4 THEN THIS BE GREATER FOLKS•ÈÀ
Prakhar Mishra ps4 game is mediocre•ÈÀ
And Spider Man in Infinity War•ÈÀ
@Jewish Jesus how•ÈÀ
Jason Hannigan your mother is mediocre•ÈÀ
F30 Rocity it's a straight rip off of Batman just with clunky fighting mechanics and boring missions and side missions. Story is cool and web swinging is cool. They are the only things that keep it worth playing. (I have 30 hours in it that's why I'm critizcing it)•ÈÀ
"The Name's Revan, Darth Revan why•ÈÀ"
PAUSE AT 1:39 SPIDER MAN PS4 LOGO BETWEEN PETER AND THE OLD LADY•ÈÀ
Prakhar Mishra and Venom is coming out•ÈÀ
"@Jewish Jesus no, people think it's Arkham rip off because they're not doing it right. Mashing square with circle occasionally is not the way to play. The combat is designed so that you improvise, mix and match different gadgets. Plus, it has a LOT more similarities with Spider-Man 2. If you have the game, try using your web shooters more often. Uppercut, web shoot 4 times then hold triangle. Web enemies on ground, near walls. Use impact webbing wisely. Use suspension matrix to get out of tough spots. It's a fantastic combat system, and even more amazing is the fact that Insomniac nailed it so well, this being their first time doing melee combat in one of their games.•ÈÀ"
@Kevin Sosa WHAT WHY DIDN'T I NOTICE THIS BEFORE AWESOME JOB MAN_Ù÷µ•ÈÀ
"@Prakhar Mishra i saw some other guy tweet it on twitter, i just wanted to share the info to Spider Man PS4 fans who didnt know about it yet!•ÈÀ"
@Kevin Sosa thanks a lot man. Insomniac's Spider-Man is also in the recent Spider-Geddon event•ÈÀ

Cool concept but not watching cause my Spider-Man isn‰Ûªt black nor would I pay money to go out of my way to see a black Spider-Man... literal and metaphorically•ÈÀ

Peni Parker•ÈÀ
SP//dr is the name of the last one btw.•ÈÀ
The ghost spider is the skull with blue flames.•ÈÀ
@Unknown Enemy Ghost Spider is Gwen's new Spider name in the comics. That's why Ghost Spider was renamed Spirit Spider in SM PS4.•ÈÀ
"It's Spider-Ham, not Spider-Pig.•ÈÀ"
"@Jolanos Oh, i see why they changed it now, i thought it was because the spirit of vengeance.•ÈÀ"

I love you dad•ÈÀ
"Something missing...1.Where's Miguel O'Hara?2.Tobey,Andrew,Tom cameo?3.Spider-Man TOEI?•ÈÀ"
Carolus Mark Ezra I doubt they would want to spoil cameos in the trailer•ÈÀ
"Yes, we need Leopardon•ÈÀ"
"0:10 This isn‰Ûªt actually Toby, but here‰Ûªs a reference to the movies he was in•ÈÀ"
Yeah because they'd totally show that in a movie trailer•ÈÀ
"@Dojokid500 I know but i mean, Tobey,Tom,Andrew play Spider-Man but not their Spider-Man•ÈÀ"
Also one more thing...Where's J. Jonah Jameson?•ÈÀ

I love the original spiderman references!!•ÈÀ
nice  concept•ÈÀ
"And this is how you make an animated movie in 2018, DC.•ÈÀ"
“øÓ“Ïã-ah chill mate this is like marvel first good animated movie. DC have had plenty of great animated movies.•ÈÀ
I am imagining Marco Diaz taking coffee like in your profile pic and saying that lol•ÈÀ
Its Sony's movie who have purchased rights from Marvel!•ÈÀ
- and how about you just stop comparing DC with marvel.•ÈÀ
DC made far better animated movies than Marvel in last 10 years•ÈÀ
"Only thing that sucks in DC is DC live action movies. The comics, the games and cartoons are far superioir that that of marvel's.•ÈÀ"
Lol that‰Ûªs a is literally the first good marvel animated movie ever. Dc has more than enough.•ÈÀ
"1, how do u know its good?2. what animated movie did dc make in 2018 that was bad?•ÈÀ"
Batman under the red hood anyone...Justice League Dark...Batman mask of the phantasm•ÈÀ
“øÓ“Ïã-ah DC has TONS of amazing animated movies. Where have you been? This might actually be Marvel‰Ûªs best animated movie. The only other animation they‰Ûªve had is The Spectacular Spider-Man and that was great. Don‰Ûªt try to start to flame war when you don‰Ûªt understand another company‰Ûªs success.•ÈÀ
Dc has alot of good animated movies and it's better than marvel's. This is maybe the first good marvel animated film. So stop trashing dc cuz mcu movies are better. You can't just judge dc cuz u watched justuce league lmao•ÈÀ
"i cant believe someone can be this ignorant lmfaocomparing Marvel to DC out of nowhere not even realising that they're WAY better than Marvel at animated movies and shows•ÈÀ"
@dylan jackson also we dont know if it is gonna be good at first•ÈÀ
Yeah only from Sony and not really marvel themselves who constantly fucked up their animation. Also Sony animation is that done the emojis movie•ÈÀ
Marvel is just catching up here•ÈÀ
You sir are a complete idiot. Probably never even seen a DC animated movie.•ÈÀ
Try beat Batman Ninja then we talk!•ÈÀ
"What are you talking about, DC is awesome at making animated movies and thats a fact•ÈÀ"
"DC be coming out with good stuff,like teen titans the judas contract•ÈÀ"
The new 52 movies have been lacking. But everything before was miles ahead of Marvel‰Ûªs animation.•ÈÀ
I think he means Washington DC•ÈÀ
Blind hate for DC gets upvotes. This dude probably never watched a DC animation in his life.•ÈÀ
"Nah DC's good at the animated ones, they're cancer with the live action ones•ÈÀ"
"Polis Angkasa Gaban Batman Ninja was stupid. Lmao. It was super fun, but it was one of the dumbest animated movies I‰Ûªve ever seen.•ÈÀ"
DC cartoons are far more superior than Marvel cartoons lol•ÈÀ
"This look really bad comare to dc movies like assult on harkam, tdkr, the lego batman movie,flashpoint and more•ÈÀ"
"Relax bro, this isn't even a Marvel animated movie. It's made by Sony. Marvel will never be able to match DC in animated movies.•ÈÀ"
"Teen Titans Go! To The Movies still got a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating, that's pretty impressive•ÈÀ"
DC made a lot of good animated movies•ÈÀ
dc knows how to make animated movies lmao•ÈÀ
Making that big of a judgment even before seeing the movie? Nice•ÈÀ
Naw mate.. DC rules animated movies! Especially with the Batman ones _ÙÔÛ Teen Titans vs. Justice League is also fire. So many good ones•ÈÀ
Shut the hell up puppet•ÈÀ
"Actually, DC stomps Marvel at animations but Marvel destroys DC at movies•ÈÀ"
"I wish Justice League: Gods and Monsters got a bit more budget and a theatrical release, I would've been juiced to see that in a cinema•ÈÀ"
"You know the Teen Titans Go movie has a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, right?•ÈÀ"
I‰Ûªm pretty sure Big Hero 6 was based on a Marvel property.•ÈÀ
"Hahaha what a stupid kid. In live action movies Marvel is better, but in animated movies DC is completely on a different level.•ÈÀ"
"As far as I know, this year DC made Batman Ninja, which was pretty crazy and rad, and Teen Titans Go, which was hilarious and is an example of how to make a Deadpool-style movie for kids.•ÈÀ"
dc has done a better job with animated movies for years unlike with marvel•ÈÀ
MCFLY bh6 wasn‰Ûªt even that good•ÈÀ
DC and Marvel are really good but Marvel's live action movies are better than DC's in my opinion•ÈÀ
Idk Spider-Man PS4 is pre good.•ÈÀ
"DC‰Ûªs best movies are arguably it‰Ûªs animated ones. With the exception of say, Wonder Woman, many of their recent films have been disasters. Almost all of their animated ones are actually pretty enjoyable.•ÈÀ"
Tissan Young it was meant for Japanese audiences more so than American audiences•ÈÀ
so weird seeing a cgi movie that looks like its been shot on 3's or even 4's. I guess that what makes it stand out•ÈÀ
No racism in me as I love black women and they love me but a black spiderman? Really?•ÈÀ
Whoa!•ÈÀ

Alright this is awesome•ÈÀ

Wow i love spider•ÈÀ
Song at the end title screen?•ÈÀ
Is that you Disney•ÈÀ
Looks better than the Spider man homecoming .•ÈÀ
"So is the this the ""Tobey Maguire,Sam Raimi"" Peter Parker? Saw at least two Raimi Spiderman 2 references.•ÈÀ"
Forgot to mention the SpiderMan 1 reference. The MJ upsidedown kiss.•ÈÀ
"Train scene, Kissing scene when he is upside down and in the restaurant when the car flies in.•ÈÀ"
"3 actually, the car throw in the diner from spiderman 2, stoping the train from 2 and inverted kissing from 1•ÈÀ"
The one in the new ps4 game makes a spiderman 2 reference•ÈÀ
I believe so.•ÈÀ
I‰Ûªd guess it‰Ûªll be like LEGO Batman where it references multiple past versions•ÈÀ
Plus was that spider-pig from the Simpsons?•ÈÀ
"Glad to see Spider-Ham finally getting some love on the big screen. In case people don't know, he was a popular comic book series back in the 80's.•ÈÀ"
Those were even in the game its like a staple at this point•ÈÀ
I counted 3.•ÈÀ
"NinjasCreedZA imo they‰Ûªre just funny nods. Like ‰ÛÏI saved the city, got the girl‰Û etc and for examples they just show those as references. But hey, could be wrong. If it was they should‰Ûªve got Toby to voice him.•ÈÀ"
@Nik Turk That's Spider-Ham. He's been around since the 80's•ÈÀ
The idea of a seasoned Spiderman is awesome.•ÈÀ
"@Nik Turk no, that's peter porker the spectacular Spider-ham•ÈÀ"
Nik Turk No its spiderham. Spiderham came out decades before spiderpig from the Simpson's. Spider pig was actually not very original at all.•ÈÀ
"@Nik Turk no, spider-ham is an actual alternate reality Spidey where everyone is an anthropomorphic animal. His name is Peter Porker. No joke.•ÈÀ"
Yeah they are coz my be its continuity of sony spider universe•ÈÀ
@munkeemojo ok thanks•ÈÀ
This IS TOBEY MAQUIRE•ÈÀ
"That isn't Tobey's Spiderman. Tobey's Spiderman has organic webs, this Spiderman has webshooters. Also ps4 Spiderman references some of those scenes as well. This is probably from the comics where Peter is 30 years old, and has a company called Parker Industries. He also has a secret base where he keeps his suits on display like Iron Man as you can see in the trailer.•ÈÀ"
X•ÈÀ
@Nik Turk Actually Spider-Ham is from another universe an was introduced in the comics before he was featured in the Simpson's•ÈÀ
The suit of spiderman ps4 1:39•ÈÀ

This looks so amazing!! Spidey for ever!!•ÈÀ
This just like the end credits of Homecoming•ÈÀ
2:28 isn't wakanda?•ÈÀ
this looks nice and funny family movie•ÈÀ
"Just pasue at 1:45 when they all look at the camera. Two things:1) Badass new wallpaper2) The blendind of art syles is GORGEOUS! Peter and Miles look more 2D classic comic book drawings, Gwen looks more 3D modern neon, Spider-ham has that child friendly animation, Peni looks like a 3D rendered anime character, and Noir (my favorite) looks like the art cover to classic mystery novels. Somehow they all blend perfectly together! Am I more excited for this than Venom? Just a little bit haha•ÈÀ"
H E Y F E L L A S•ÈÀ
"I love how they made Spider-Ham look like / did animate him in 2DAlso looks like they did it to Peni too (Thanks to people that responded)•ÈÀ"
Peni Parker aka SP//dr my dude•ÈÀ
That's Peni Parker.•ÈÀ
This art style of spiderman is DOPE AS COMIC•ÈÀ

This is the future. Welcome to exgen.•ÈÀ
Why ANIME SPIDERMAN is included???•ÈÀ
Omg this is amazing. Didn't expect Spider-Ham!!!! DC and Marvel need to do more animated movies!•ÈÀ
"Dc makes loads of animated movies, and most of them are actually really good.•ÈÀ"
DC already does lol•ÈÀ
Didnt know that there is a Spider Ham? Is he inspired by the Spider Pig?•ÈÀ
"@qwerttzizzi no, spider-ham is from 83 and spider-pig is from 2007•ÈÀ"
I meant DC should theatrically release their animated movies.•ÈÀ
"@ziljin oh, that makes more sense. Yeah I agree, if they got a bigger budget and a bit longer to make the films, i think they could be better then any of the live action movies, i fact i already prefer them, if they just had confidence in their animasion.•ÈÀ"
agree! the DC animated movies are much better than the live action ones.•ÈÀ
"Nior spider man is my favorite, second would be the 2099 spider man.•ÈÀ"

2019 will be even better with Infinity War 2 and Homecoming 2•ÈÀ
"Infinity War, yesBut this? Nah son.•ÈÀ"

Jordy Vonck Literally just a video game and an animated movie. And Infinity War I guess. Homecoming 2 is next year.•ÈÀ

Spider man infinity war•ÈÀ
"this looks incredible, but...0:47  that's not a frontflip _Ù_Ó•ÈÀ"

It looks like spiderman... but NOT Spiderman PS4 adaptation inspired kind of Spiderman.•ÈÀ
"Yeah, i'm love all spider man but don't like homecoming disney•ÈÀ"
PLEASE DON‰ÛªT BE BAD•ÈÀ
"OK that is MORE EPIC!! IM EXCITED!!! who is Excited to see this too!•ÈÀ"

At the end I think he‰Ûªs in wakanda•ÈÀ
black panther reference in the end.•ÈÀ
This is the first time I see spiderman noir being goofy•ÈÀ
"Wow this looks awful. The voices couldn‰Ûªt sound more uninspired. If I didn‰Ûªt know any better it‰Ûªd look like a bad Dreamworks film. This is coming from a massive Spidey fan.Generic crap electronic music too. No energy to it.•ÈÀ"

This looks fun....•ÈÀ
"Im so glad people are appreciating this movie, the second I saw the trailer I expected Non fans to go crazy about both the plot and art style, but true fans know about the hundreds of different spider variations , and honestly, Im a bit more hyped for this, than Venom!•ÈÀ"
Lukas Eriksson don‰Ûªt gatekeep with that true fan bullshit. You probably never even read a spider-man comic•ÈÀ
ohhh rekt mate•ÈÀ
Venom is gonna suck and this looks graphically discomforting. The FPS is AWFUL•ÈÀ
"@sanderflop lmao I was the nerdiest kid growing up, especially for spider man, I was so obsessed with him I wore a spider man costume everyday for like a month at ten years old until my mam forced me to take the costume off, to wash it obviously, I even wore it to a tenth birthday party where I refused to eat because that meant taking the mask off! _Ù÷â I still have some of the older, rarer comics to this date in the attic. Trust man, people only think of the Sam Raimi films when they think spiderman, and the universe is so much larger than those movies! Seeing other people be excited for this is a great thing to see•ÈÀ"
Lukas Eriksson Why do you have to distinguish ‰ÛÏnon-fans‰Û and ‰ÛÏtrue fans‰Û. You don‰Ûªt have to know all the trivia and variants to be a fan. Non-fans are just people who don‰Ûªt like Spider-Man.•ÈÀ
"Because ""non fans"" is the correct terminology for people who aren't a fan of spiderman, and I expected those people to get angry that it's not like the original trilogy, obviously fans are going to know about the other variations of spider man. But people think spider man and always think of Peter Parker, not the countless other versions. If you're not a fan that's fine, but it's always the none fans that complain about stuff like this, stuff they don't understand•ÈÀ"
YES! AND THEY LOOK SO DISTINCTLY DESIGNED!!!•ÈÀ
WHOOOOOO!!•ÈÀ
Spider nig•ÈÀ
Spider-Ham•ÈÀ
So they put in an Anime girl Instead of Miguel O Hara?•ÈÀ
Now that's what Sony should be doing rather than chasing live action movies like MCU•ÈÀ

Nice try with the spider pig but Simpsons did it first•ÈÀ
They didn't actually. I'm pretty sure there was a comic book about SpiderHam. Hence why in simpsons they called it spiderpig. So they couldn't get copyrighted or something i dunno•ÈÀ

Oh you're right. I'd love to see him in this.•ÈÀ
Can't reveal everything in two trailers right? Maybe he'll be a surprise in the movie•ÈÀ
At this point he is the main and only missing alternate Spider-Man•ÈÀ
They probably just sticking to current timeline spider people.•ÈÀ
@Rico World Peace true and miles and Pete I don't think are alive in 2099 and if they were they would be old asf but maybe I'm done their could be Peter Parker in different universes.•ÈÀ
Maybe it's a surprise•ÈÀ
Not yet•ÈÀ
"Oh he's totally in the movie, they're saving him for another scene maybe at the end. You can't forget the best alternate Spiderman•ÈÀ"
That would have been boss.•ÈÀ
I think they're saving 2099 for his own animated movie.•ÈÀ
too dark•ÈÀ
@Ronnie P yes exactly•ÈÀ

"I mean they still do amazing animated movies as well as their live action ones, you making it seem like they don't do animation.•ÈÀ"
They have been doing this since 1993•ÈÀ
Nah live action is more dramatic and dc can't even make film there films are boring they are a dying company that are running out of ideas•ÈÀ
MSA616 ALG cough the dark knight trilogy. Its funny you bring up that its a dying company as many people believed that about marvel when they were going bankrupt and had to sell a lot of their movie rights and the majority of marvel characters are inspired by dc characters.•ÈÀ
"@MSA616 ALG some of their animated movies are amazing, and they make some pretty good ones regularly too•ÈÀ"

1:50 that Deadpool easter egg _Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
"This might be one of my favorite movies of all time.But I have a fear that critics are gonna hate this film because they might not get the concept of multiple universes.Pray it won't come to that.•ÈÀ"
I can‰Ûªt wait for Christmas to watch this movie•ÈÀ
Now all we need is the Japanese Spider-man with a megazord and we got ourselves a blockbuster!•ÈÀ
There is a Japanese Spider-Man but he dosent have a Megazord.•ÈÀ
Yes he does. He has a a Megazord called Leopardon!•ÈÀ
they already show that jap girl with spider-bot in 1:38 so i doubt it.•ÈÀ
They're referring to the Japanese Spider-Man who had a live-action television show in the 70s that was a direct precursor to the Super Sentai series (which was eventually localized in English as Power Rangers).•ÈÀ
"I forgot Super Sentai Spider-Man existed, but i was referring to the Manga Spider-Man.•ÈÀ"

Why the hell does peni look like she is from an anime•ÈÀ

"Ok. But seriously this movie needs an appearance from Tobey or Garfield or Holland of even PS4 Spider-Man. Just one of them, maybe just an end credit scene. But man I need it. Fans would go wild if Maguire rocked up•ÈÀ"
SliceofMarge 1:39 you can spot PS4 suit in background•ÈÀ

"VENOM, SPIDER-MAN PS4 AND SPIDER VERSE 2018 is Spidermans Year_Ùªâ_Ù÷•ÈÀ"
I m still waiting for hindi dubbed venom... And nw list is updated•ÈÀ
The scanner darkly type animation for this film is perfect. The water color style painting aspect is incredible mixes with the stop motion animation sequence. Peter Parker is a fun version of Tony Stark.•ÈÀ
Do you stalk me much?•ÈÀ
I should add that Peter is also waay better in terms of personality•ÈÀ
Raghu Seetharaman Impossible. Tony Stark is the definition of fun.•ÈÀ
Your picture looks like a mugshot.•ÈÀ
"@M you do realize that if you see him everywhere, that just means that you're also spending just as much time as he is on the internet right? For Christ sakes, let the man comment on what he wants and go about your day•ÈÀ"
its not stop motion its meant to look like it•ÈÀ
@Admiraâ Hax In the movies in the comics he's no way near as charismatic as in the films.•ÈÀ
Dude really? Darkly type animation? Can we stop making dumb jokes because Miles is black?•ÈÀ
"scanner darkly,like spiderman•ÈÀ"
I havent thought about Scanner Darkly in fucking forever. What a fucking trip of a movie.•ÈÀ
Bruh you're everywhere.•ÈÀ
Scanner darkly comparison is _ÙÔÎ•ÈÀ
"Grow up, cuckolds.•ÈÀ"
At last adult Pete is back.•ÈÀ
It‰Ûªs nothing like its animation considering they used real people and added effects. This is all drawn out in a computer like what Pixar does. I think you need to learn filming lmfao•ÈÀ
"Scanner Darkly type animation??? Stop motion????? dude, what the hell are you talking about. You and the hundreds of people who thumbs you up don't know anything about animation. it's kinda embarrassing, but I get it, when you don't know how to describe it, you just use the closest things that come to mind as examples, even tho they are wayyyy off.•ÈÀ"
"""So so popsicle""_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ"
Huh?_Ùªã_Ùªã•ÈÀ
AMAZING!•ÈÀ
Can you tell I‰Ûªm happy about Spider-Ham.•ÈÀ
man this fall is spidey time the new game went over great we got venom dropping soon and now this coming as my own christmas treat•ÈÀ
"Hey its my christmas treatOk maybe we can share•ÈÀ"
"Spider pig, spider pig, the only reason I'm seeing this movie.•ÈÀ"
Oh yeah!!!! Spider-verse!!! Spider-verse!!!!! I can't wait to see this movie on December 14th. :D•ÈÀ
Did nobody get the refrence of spiderman 2 with the car scene lmao i laughed when he just punched the car•ÈÀ
Dawayne jordan everybody get it•ÈÀ
"Yep, just like we all saw him stopping the subway train as well•ÈÀ"
Yup•ÈÀ
Thomas Gardner and kissing Mary Jane upside down.•ÈÀ
wasnt a subway•ÈÀ
Everyone got it.•ÈÀ
So it doesn't bother you that he is in his suit in a restaurant•ÈÀ
Antony D'Andrea  He said it was a subway train not that it was a actual subway•ÈÀ
Can you dub In tamil•ÈÀ
The last guy looks like Ned Leeds. And also SPIDER-MAN NOIR!!!•ÈÀ
He looks like ganke•ÈÀ
"King Char is ganke, and ned leeds is ganke with different name•ÈÀ"
@sedef122003 oooooo ok i don't know who ganke is•ÈÀ
Noticed that too•ÈÀ
"@King Char Ned from homecoming was based on ganke Lee, mile's lego loving best friend...•ÈÀ"
Ganke is Miles morales best friend  who Marvel changed into Ned Leds for homecoming.•ÈÀ
And now we wait for 2099 Spider Man.•ÈÀ
Noir voiced by Nicholas Cage•ÈÀ
@Joseph Perez thanks•ÈÀ
lol•ÈÀ
The animation looks awesome._Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷•ÈÀ
"2:29- Spiderman is Black Panther. Spiderman: ""Wakanda Forever!""•ÈÀ"
"Yo,dude,amazing look out lmao _Ù_£_Ù_£•ÈÀ"
IM EARLY YAY•ÈÀ
I hope this isn't the on e at the end of venom :(•ÈÀ
‰ÛÏDo animals talk in this universe cause I don‰Ûªt wanna freak him out‰Û lmao•ÈÀ
I just realized Spider-Pig is a reference to the Simpsons Movie.•ÈÀ
"Looks very cool!Good one Sony!!•ÈÀ"
"Looks amazingBut it's too. Much spider•ÈÀ"
I like how each of them have their own unique design and style!!! This movies gonna be awesome!!!!!•ÈÀ
Super•ÈÀ
QUE FODA•ÈÀ
XDDD If they have sex would it be like insest•ÈÀ
wish the toys were better•ÈÀ
They giving my boy miles some recognition_ÙÔÎ•ÈÀ
"Spider ham, noir Spider-Man, spider gwen and is that Asian Spider-Man? XD•ÈÀ"
Looks SO much better than Venom.•ÈÀ
"'Venom' critic reactions all basically say it's a car crash -  ""Worse than Catwoman. A total failure. This years Fant4stic. Tom Hardy's worst ever performance"". At least this movie still looks incredible!•ÈÀ"
"One critic has said that at the moment with most say it's a mixed bag where Tom hardy had a good relationship with venom and it's quite funny, but nothing special. Aka definition of a mixed bag. The only other fully negative comment I can find at the moment is calling it a turd in the wind but yet again others love it.... I feel it'll be fun but not great•ÈÀ"
I don‰Ûªt know why Sony even bothers. They should‰Ûªve given venom to Marvel•ÈÀ
never believe critics. they're all idiots•ÈÀ
"@jack lajoie if a vast majority of people are saying venom is bad, even people who wanted to like it I'd believe it over blindly paying to see something thats complete garbage. Venom looks like it has bits in it but making a venom movie detached from his original origins destroys the entire purpose of their even being a venom.•ÈÀ"
"If Tom Hardy's that good as Eddie Brock/Venom, then if the movie bombs and the SUMC universe is dead, they can just shoehorn Eddie into the MCU by having him go through a multi-verse portal Doctor Strange accidentally creates.•ÈÀ"
A lot those Twitter reactions were by fake accounts who trying to promote A star is born.•ÈÀ
"@TheCreed1217 Tell that to marvel. that's not stopping them with the whole ""god of the symbiotes"" BS.•ÈÀ"
"@StardustCrusade No they weren't. They're all by official blue-tick accounts that work for major publications. Some Gaga fans are posting fake reactions but that happens whenever a Marvel/DC movie is released by the fans of the opposite camp anyway, and it doesn't change the fact that all of the OFFICIAL reviews are negative.•ÈÀ"
@Hitmonkey source?•ÈÀ
"@StardustCrusade Literally just search venom on twitter and all the official critic reactions are in the ""top tweets"" section. All Negative.•ÈÀ"
5k viewer•ÈÀ
Starting to think that old spidey is tobey‰Ûªs Spider Man in his dimension _Ù_Ó•ÈÀ
WHERE'S 2099?•ÈÀ
"Black Spiderman... Haha funnyOne day all Hollywood movie will be of Black people. If the rumors true, Superman also gonna be black. Ha ha ha•ÈÀ"
I‰Ûªm so ready this looks so poppin_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´_ÙÓ´•ÈÀ
"Well it does makes you FEEL like Spider-Man, Miles•ÈÀ"
Hey i had saw the same story in the sires of ULTIMATE SPIDERMAN•ÈÀ
Vrushal Meshram the spider verse storyline isn't exclusive to just the cartoon show.. They have done spider verse in comics too and in the 90's animated version too except those all were just alternate peter parkers•ÈÀ
@agent v006 ok.......thx for the imformation•ÈÀ
Vrushal Meshram no prob lol•ÈÀ
BLACK PANTHER REFERENCE AT THE VERY END OMFG•ÈÀ
"2018 is a good year for Spidey fans. We got to see him in IW, then the Ps4 game, Venom is closer and now this•ÈÀ"
Thus the movie connects the Raimi Verse•ÈÀ
The 00CC I know that but I am talking about the series of incidents thus trailer shows. Like Saving the train and Kissing MJ•ÈÀ
So beautiful•ÈÀ
The Web Warriors all here•ÈÀ
"Not really, where is Mayday? (or rather faux Mayday)•ÈÀ"
Do animals talk in this dimension?cuz I don‰Ûªt wanna freak him out. poor dude passes out immediately•ÈÀ
16 year old me would have laughed to that hysterically.•ÈÀ
That must be Ned Leeds•ÈÀ
Steve Lang why is he POOR•ÈÀ
@fitrah zulkarnain sounds more like John Mullaney to me•ÈÀ
"@fitrah zulkarnain It's Ganke, Ned Leeds in Homecoming is a copy of Ganke.•ÈÀ"
How could he not freak out if he's witnessing six people on the ceiling•ÈÀ
"oops sorry, it IS Ganke.. forgot which universe is•ÈÀ"

@David Blyth I've yet to see it but I hope it's one of those ones where critics hate it but the public loves it•ÈÀ
@David Blyth you know how many times audience is totally different from what the critics like•ÈÀ
No one•ÈÀ

Brasil ???•ÈÀ
Cute anime girl Spider-Man?!•ÈÀ
Yeah•ÈÀ
YES•ÈÀ
She's supposed to be Peni Parker who pilots a mech called SP//dr and fights spiderman themed monsters. Basically Evangelion Spiderman. Although they changed the mech design in this movie which I'm kind of bummed about.•ÈÀ
@Temple King well they have to cut corners to put SP//dr in the movie.•ÈÀ
"She‰Ûªs freakin adorable, they should make a spin off animated miniseries based on her•ÈÀ"
"Chanler Bordeaux Yeah that is understandable. Probably would be very difficult to animate.And yes, I would like to see a short or spin off of SP//dr one day since I think it's a cool idea.•ÈÀ"
@Temple King Edge of Spiderverse you can find for SP//dr•ÈÀ

I dont like the fact they cant just stick with one spider man we had like 4 spider mans now come on•ÈÀ
This isn't a reboot•ÈÀ
@The Real Michael Garcia im talking about the movies not this•ÈÀ
They released this to distract you from the VENOM reviews.•ÈÀ
Captain Zeal are the reviews bad?•ÈÀ
"The reviews aren‰Ûªt out yet. Unfortunately, they probably won‰Ûªt be great, which is a shame.•ÈÀ"
@Ham Burglar they are out•ÈÀ
Yup•ÈÀ
@Ham Burglar Some are and they're obviously negative•ÈÀ
Captain Zeal ‰ÛÏearly ‰ÛÏ reviews•ÈÀ
Social reviews are out. Not looking good so far.•ÈÀ
"@Nathan Lemuel the reviews are mixed, you guys are acting as if it's straight up negative•ÈÀ"
Ham Burglar they're out and they're so bad•ÈÀ
Flik Rancherson it's at least 70% negative•ÈÀ
Idc about the reviews i going to check it out for my self•ÈÀ
@ElijahDawgOne most reviews on twitter are bots all saying the same stuff about the movie being bad•ÈÀ
Flik Rancherson I‰Ûªm not.  I‰Ûªm being realistic. They are mixed to negative. The only good thing that is being said is Tom Hardy‰Ûªs performance. And even that is a mixed bag. People are just confused by the movie.•ÈÀ
And what a good distraction!•ÈÀ
"The reviews are no true out, just the social media reactions.•ÈÀ"
"@Nathan Lemuel I've literally reread all the articles just now, the positives have said that the movie has charm as well as great main character dynamic, there's a lot more to it than just mixed to negative, I'll hold my opinion for when the critics get a hold of it.•ÈÀ"
@Nathan Lemuel I feel bad for Tom Hardy. He went from Dunkirk to this.•ÈÀ
This first reviews fells like the first one's from Deadpool 2 that said was a boring movie with nothing to offer.•ÈÀ
Flik Rancherson And all of that positive buzz has to do with Tom Hardy.•ÈÀ
Flik Rancherson Critics did get a hold of it. Some of them. At the Hollywood premiere.•ÈÀ
Captain Zeal He went from Inception to this.•ÈÀ
@Nathan Lemuel He's already started distancing himself from the movie saying 40 minutes of it were cut.•ÈÀ
Captain Zeal Pulling a Jared Leto I see.•ÈÀ
"And by reviews he means 1000s of bots plugging Lady Gaga's new film and a couple of ""reviews"" from some Twitter randos.•ÈÀ"
"@A Skeleton You're right about the  lady gaga bots, just read about it now. But there are mixed to negative reviews by genuine sources.•ÈÀ"
@Nathan Lemuel Lmao yeah. Venom got zacksnydered.•ÈÀ
https://twitter.com/_brooklynbatman/status/1047082514488201216?s=21•ÈÀ
"@Nathan Lemuel Even though the lady gaga film is getting positive reviews, it will be tough for it to beat Venom. First, venom is one of the most popular marvel characters, second it's a superhero genre film. Unless in the coming days it gets completely panned like Fantastic 4, i think it will do okay at the box office.•ÈÀ"
Captain Zeal I‰Ûªm pretty sure it will be number one at the box office on opening weekend. Maybe its second week too. Depends on general word of mouth.•ÈÀ

Alright let's go into the spider verse my boy miles and Peter along with Spider-Man noir yes let's go who is excited for this and venom.•ÈÀ
"After those Venom reviews my hype for that has flatlined, but this looks amazing.•ÈÀ"
"@Hitmonkey Fawk critic reviews, I'll watch the movie and form my own opinion•ÈÀ"
"@MikeNoir Critic reviews almost always align with my own opinion tbh, so I'm pretty sure I'll hate it.•ÈÀ"
@Mike Noir I will do the same but i want both of these films to do well•ÈÀ
Epic ! This is a must _ÙÔ_Ù÷ä•ÈÀ
Spidy•ÈÀ
Why is everyone so obsessed with Spider-Man  now? And spider man isn‰Ûªt black. Sorry...•ÈÀ
ZeroSV but there trying to change up the history of spider man just so they don‰Ûªt offend anyone•ÈÀ
I'm happy with both... Love Peter always will but change is good... Like batman always will be Bruce Wayne.. But batman beyond is good too•ÈÀ
Beningame dude he was introduced in the ultimate comics. Im not a big fan of him either but hes been a staple for a lotta years my dude. This is just focusing on the ultimate universe colliding with the other universes. Also miles is black and Hispanic mix.•ÈÀ
shadonic565 eeh ok seems good•ÈÀ
Holy moly spider•ÈÀ
Spider Gwen!•ÈÀ
Good!!•ÈÀ
Can't wait! 2018 shaping up to be a good year for Spidey.•ÈÀ
Well we were so excited about venom but now we gotta figure out a dish to dedicate to this!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
J-Mac's Amateur Kitchen i want these songs•ÈÀ
I bet this movie is gonna be AMAZING•ÈÀ
This will wipe the floor with Venom•ÈÀ
J-Mac's Amateur Kitchen THIS ISGONNA BE AWESOME•ÈÀ
J-Mac's Amateur Kitchen Literally no-one is excited for Venom.•ÈÀ
I understand spider ham and noir spider man being in here but way do got anime spider roboot in here way cant we get spiderman 2099. Or  Superior spiderman•ÈÀ
Hack even black suit spiderman•ÈÀ
Ben rally•ÈÀ
Or even the other ben rally the red and black one•ÈÀ
I'm actually not excited for Venom so i'm not going to go see it.•ÈÀ
The fact people actually think this movie is gonna be better than venom is an actual joke in itself•ÈÀ
@Sonic171000  guset we just got wait and see•ÈÀ
Yeah First_Ù÷•ÈÀ
yeeee•ÈÀ
Spidey Os _Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
CANY WAIT•ÈÀ
Alert Tyrone magnus.•ÈÀ
MG16NCP got it•ÈÀ
"After the Venom movie later this week, I really can't wait for this. The animation style looks very unique, like a mix of 2D and 3D art. This would be the start of Sony's animated Spider-Verse with multiple Spider characters in a film! ""How many of us are there?"" _ÙÔ•ÈÀ"
"2018 is a good year for Spidey fans. We got to see him in IW, then the Ps4 game, Venom is closer and now this•ÈÀ"
"@Luis Manuel Deras He's not gonna be in Venom though, maybe at most a surprise cameo but I doubt so at the moment. They should really make the first Venom film solely based on Venom vs Riot and not foreshadow others like Spider-Man or Carnage. Tom Hardy has signed on for 2 more Venom films anyway, so they have plenty of time!•ÈÀ"
can wait to see venom and this movie looks solid also•ÈÀ
@Jurassic Galaxy I know he won't be there. I meant we have had spidey material all over the year•ÈÀ
@Luis Manuel Deras That's not wrong!•ÈÀ
"@Jurassic Galaxy its awesomeeeeee. I'm in the middle of Spiderman ps4, I already got my tickets for Venom. I need that prequel book about Spiderman ps4. Woo hooooooo•ÈÀ"
3 Movies which have Spidey I know only 2 but maybe venom who knows•ÈÀ
@Luis Manuel Deras I can't wait to watch Venom on Oct 4! My channel already has a playlist of more than 80 Venom videos #WeAreVenom•ÈÀ
"Noah Cornett sorry to disappoint you, but Venom might actually be very bad. New reviews are out•ÈÀ"
COMIC BOOK FEEL YALL :D•ÈÀ
is this a series or a movie? cuz i want a series•ÈÀ
wow amazing!!!! We like spider _Ù÷÷•ÈÀ
I hope this movie is good•ÈÀ
"What makes you different, is what makes you Spider-Man!•ÈÀ"
"yeah, it's really not that deep of a quote•ÈÀ"
well he's black is that what makes him Spider-man•ÈÀ
what makes your eyes blue - is why they aren't green! - feel motivated pls•ÈÀ
"feel motivated pls, well you asked nicely soooo...•ÈÀ"
"haha, nice•ÈÀ"
The Sam Raimi Spider-Man references 10/10•ÈÀ
Yup!•ÈÀ
0:11•ÈÀ
*references•ÈÀ
"Maybe it is him,•ÈÀ"
It's in the spideman ps4 too•ÈÀ
"Kiss Train And Car Enters in a Hotel•ÈÀ"
@Quantum yep Exactly•ÈÀ
ZeroSV wait I thought it was Toby from the movie 2002 version of spider man•ÈÀ
There was a reference to it in the new Spider-Man game as well. So awesome•ÈÀ
Ikr•ÈÀ
"stopping the train, the upside down kiss and te car being thrown through the window are the refrences.Luv me some Raimi love•ÈÀ"
Think it is supposed to be the Tobey Maguire Peter Parker. Best Spidey ever.•ÈÀ
It's probably just that exact version of Spidey•ÈÀ
Sam Raimi's Spiderman 1 and 2 are still the best Superhero movies.•ÈÀ
ZeroSV this is a good year for spider man fans•ÈÀ
Looks better than lame Aquaman and Shazam put together!•ÈÀ
OGMillyMillz Vs Anybody can‰Ûªt you just enjoy something without shitting on the other ?•ÈÀ
"@Muhammad Abdullah Yeah what's the point? Leave it, he's just a troll.•ÈÀ"
"Shitting on DC is cool right? you look old in your stupid pic , didn't expect you  to say something childish•ÈÀ"
This is a Sony movie btw. Not Marvel. Just making sure you know.•ÈÀ
OGMillyMillz Vs Anybody I rather watch both along with the next Avengers movie•ÈÀ
Wow way to kill the mood•ÈÀ
Don‰Ûªt forget that this is done by the same people who done emoji movie•ÈÀ
Ray Wilson I didn‰Ûªt bother seeing Emoji movie•ÈÀ
