"Beautiful story, beautiful movie_ŸŒ¸ I have a story to share with you. For a long time I had planned to see this movie, (mostly because Eddie Redmayne is my favorite actor since 2012 when I saw him in Les Miserables) but it never happened ,you know what I mean? This year I finally decided to watch it,  and I loved it! It was like I got to know Stephen, sure I had heard of him before, but I suddenly learned so much more. I was completely blown away by this story, and the music was something extremely powerful that I always cried to, and I couldnâ€™t stop listen to it.About 2 days later the news were everywhere, and it for real broke my heart. Stephen is no longer with us, but I think heâ€™s sitting up there somewhere, still exploring the universe_Ÿ’«âœ¨ He was a brilliant man, he knew what he was doing and had a head that is too unbelievable to understand. I feel kind of cursed because of this, how can he pass away 2 days later, just when I got to know him??... I will miss you deeply, Stephen, and I send all love to you in Heaven_Ÿ’•_ŸŒ·_ŸŒ_ Rest in peace, Professor, the angels must watch over you_Ÿ‘__Ÿè»ï»¿"
"Heaven?? The angels must watch over you??? Ffs. Hawkins was a scientist and said that there was no afterlife and no god, so don't disrespect his memory by talking about fairy tails and mumbo jumbo bullshit about an  invisible man living in the skyï»¿"

This man, this incredible man meant so much to me. To everybody. He was a fucking inspiration to science and to battling against the odds. So I'm so disappointed in myself for not being able to watch such an amazing tribute to his life. I know that if I do, I'll break down and I'm not ready for that. I keep coming back to the trailer for some reason and even that makes me cry. So I don't think I'll be able to handle the actual movie,ï»¿"

Stephen Hawking is best foreeverï»¿
"It all started with the execution of one specific equation and the equation expanded to the infinity forming so called universe, and concept of material.Just like how mandelbrot set works, it starts with a simple mathematical equation where you can execute in any programming language, you get more and more details as you iterate through the equation.Our understandings are only limited to our sensory organs, and the things we perceive are only the by-product of first execution of the specific equation.This was just a philosophical approach to the origin of everything and an attempt to explain what happened just before the big bang occured, to sum it up all, the initial fractal pattern that was originated from the equation caused an infinite set of fractal branches what we call ""the big bang"", every first fractal branches that's originated from the first body fractal is a universe and the other branches that's originated from these ""universe fractal branches"" are the matter, ""matter"" branches ramify to what we perceive, the material, the third dimension.From what we know about the fractals, the first iteration of the fractal ramifies to two more branches, so the first two branches are the first and only two universes that will ramify to everything else.ï»¿"

"STEPHEN HAWKINGHey YOU ALL, I know why Stephen Hawkings had that Lou Gehrig's Disease all of his life and I know why he died. I am going to send you a link where you can see a picture that he doesn't have any teeth kacky so all these years he had gum disease and gum disease has been eating on him and that's why he died!!!Â  That's why he was sick all of his life life!!! HisÂ  dentist did not cure his gum disease and just let all of his teeth rot out and which made him sick all of his life!!!Â  Â So his Dentist and Doctors could work andÂ  some money off of his teeth and sickness all of his life!!!Â  Whoooo that's outrageous!!!Â  And is CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!!LarryHey all of you beautiful PEOPLE OUT THERE, I WANT YOU TO NEVER EVER, EVER GET ANOTHER CAVITY OR GET SICK OR DIE OF GUM DISEASE!!! GUM DISEASE IS WHATS ON MY MIND!!! I WANT TO STOP THE DENTIST AND DOCTOR'S CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!! Don't let your DENTIST, DOCTOR or GUM DISEASE SLOWLY ROB you of ALL of your TEETH your HEALTH and your LIFE!Â  All because they didn't cure your GUM DISEASE IN THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU FIRST GOT YOUR GUM DISEASE!!!Â  REAL NICE GUYS A!!!Go to YouTube and type in (cure your gum disease, periodontal disease before it kills you YES YOU)Â  Under this video it tells you where you can buy CLINDAMYCIN!!Â  It ALSO tells you what you need to know about Clindamycin!!Then type in to view the next video (is YOUR dentist ripping you off.)Â  Is he ever!!!Â  Here you will see for yourself,Â  FOR SURE!!Â  FOR SURE!!Â  THAT THE DENTISTS AND DOCTORS ARE OUT AND OUT RIP OFFS, THIEVES, FELONS, CRIMINALS!!Â  Running their SICK deadly SCAM that equals CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!!Next video is (Dr. Modovan on the Doctors Show Treating Periodontal Disease) IN THIS VIDEO THEY SAY THAT THERE ARE 65 MILLION PEOPLE WHOÂ  HAVE GUM DISEASE AND MOST OF THEM DONâ€™T EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE!!!Â  (THE QUESTION IS WHY DONâ€™T THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS, THE DEADLIEST DISEASE IN THE WORLD???Â  GUM DISEASE!!!) Its killing everyone on EARTH!!! (BECAUSE THEIR DENTIST DID NOT TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE AND THAT WITH GUM DISEASE THEY ARE GOING START LOSING THEIR TEETH AND GET SICK AND DIE FROM IT!!!Â  REAL NICE GUYS!!Â  Also at the start of the video he said that he was told that he had EXTRAÂ  BLEEDING!!Â  (THIS TELLS YOU HIS DENTIST KNEW ALL ALONG (FOR YEARS AND YEARS) THAT HIS DENTIST KNEW THAT HE HAD GUM DISEASE AND DID NOT CURE HIM WITH CLINDAMYSIN!!!Â  Just view the X-RAYS and you will be able to see the the major bone DAMAGE around his teeth!!!Â  This guy said that he brushes his teeth three times a day, flosses two times a day, goes to the dentist three times a year to have his Teeth cleaned and STILL has major damage (EVEN HAD AN ABSCESS which is DEADLY in its SELF) to his bone around his teeth (GUM DISEASE) and his dentist did not tell him that he had gum disease and his dentist KNEW for years that he had GUM DISEASE and did not tell him.Â  (How would the dentist know?Â  (SWOLLEN GUMS and x-rays)Â  The dentist just sat back and let the damage HAPPEN!!Â  So he (THE DENTIST) could make a lot of MONEY filling all of the THOSE CAVITIES etc. that you can see when he opens his mouth!!!!Â  If the dentist would have given him CLINDAMYCIN when his gum disease first started he would still have all of his beautiful white permanent to this very DAY!!(Here in the below video you will see what GUM DISEASE DOES TO YOUR HEART!!! GUM DISEASE IS THE (ONLY REASON) PEOPLE HAVE HEART ATTACKS AND DIE!!!)Video name is (periodontal disease can lead to HEART DISEASE)Also type in (Cure, Schizophrenia, Psychiatry, Bipolar, Psychological Disorder) ITS GUM DISEASE THAT IS CAUSING PEOPLE TO BECOME CRAZY AND NOTHING ELSE!Next Video (gum disease narrated)Â  Man Oh MAN, This video will explain it all, the real TRUTH about GUM DISEASE by examining an EXPLAINING the X-RAYs of someone that has a severe CASE of GUM DISEASE!!Â  (gum disease narrated) Must SEE video!!Next Video (gum disease)Â  This video, is a video of my ARTICLE that tells you HOW and WHAT I went through while I was under ATTACK of GUM DISEASE!!Â  You will know it's my video when it say Larry Neiderhiser.Another must see video is.Â  (Periodontal Disease, Heart Disease Port Rowan Care Dental)Â  There are lots of OTHER videos out there that tell that Gum Disease causes other diseases! LIKE HEART ATACKS!! ETC.Â  ETC.Â  ETC.If you have gum disease and don't get CURED you are FOR SURE, FOR SURE going to die Early and die a miserable death!!This will save your life!Â  And end the doctors and dentist SCAM of not CURING YOU OF GUM DISEASE AND NOT telling you about gum disease and how deadly it is!!Look out!! GUM DISEASE, (PERIODONTAL DISEASE) is GOING TO KILL YOU if not cured!!Â  For Sure, FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!!Your dentist is a crook just like the rest of the dentists!Â  If he did not GIVE YOU CLINDAMYSIN TO CURE YOUR GUM DISEASE HE IS JUST LETTING THE GUM DISEASE BACTERIA EAT YOU UP !!ï»¿"

"u want to know everything? i can tell u everything.Its something that a person can not imagine im 14 years old but i have a mind that god had gifted it to me,no one would believe this but im just going to say : my friend told me that there was infinite universes {a theory},i was amazed and so much interested about that subject.things that i might say now might make u say that im crazy , some might not understand a thing but i just want to spread this message btw my name is hussein Ali Sayed from lebanon.the multiverse is a huge huge huge thing but it isnt everything , if the multiverse theory is true then lets say a person in this world is a bully at school so this means that in another universe he is the bullied one and that also represents every other single personality and divided into multiple universes lets take that u have 40 things that represents u (its infinite but this is just an example) then this takes u to be a person in 40 universes, this is what id like to call theory of personality. Now another thing , i believe of aliens, now here's why if we are in this HUGE multiverse, logically it wasnt made for us only to discover,people recently discovered that theres O2 in mars then this means that theres life but mars doesnt have anyone on it but they never ever discovered what in inside mars, i believe that inside mars there are living beings , beings that think,act and feel like us .if u want to think deeper and believe that the multiverse theory is real, then i believe that god is just making us like experiments for him if there are aliens because god wouldnt make aliens that are not more advanced than us , because after all god isnt an idiot if u know what im saying, so aliens are existed if not in this universe its in another one. thank you for everyone who is reading this and please spread this message,im not looking for fame, i just want everyone to know this, thank you and have a great day.ï»¿"

"This movie was great.  It was truly heartbreaking to see a person slowly lose their the ability to move, speak, etc. But it was also inspiring to see him beat the odds. Even though Mr. Hawking had different views regarding religion, i have a great deal of respect for him may he r.i.p . By the way, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones we're brilliant in this.ï»¿"

I hated her so much when she cheated on him I know it's not that easy to live with a disabled husband .However If she truly had loved him she would've loved him for who he truly is and shouldn't have cheated on himï»¿
Be You she didnâ€™t cheat on him. He left her for his nurse. He just wrote a letter to her to tell her he was leaving her. He didnâ€™t even have the courage to end his marriage face to face.ï»¿
"No, donâ€™t you understand that she has a lot of courage to actually marry him when she knows that he would live for two more years. Plus, she did not cheat on him and abandon him, she just basically stop loving him but she still take care him. She only officially married to the other guy after she end the relationship with Hawkingï»¿"
"Erika Vasquez You are not right as well, the moment he tells her he is going to travel with his nurse and then later his wife said I have loved you. That is the end of their relationship. The letter was for her to go with him to meet the queen as his official wife since they didnâ€™t officially divorce.ï»¿"

"some people are saying that stephen is an ethiest and he is not obeying god . he had tried  to know who he is and for what purpose he was come to the world.if you people think that he is wrong why you are not giving them some proof to prove them wrong.it is not a right thing to say about some one that he is not obeying our religion so he well go to hell......and God like those people who are trying to know about something not to believe on old storiesï»¿"
"When I was on my own world of Art, I started to think about movies I could watch. I stumble upon this movie. 'The Theory Of Everything'. I thought, cool, I can watch watch this for like all day. So, I put down my pencil and my sketch pad, mainly focus on the device, and watch it. I realized, it was the life of Stephen Hawking! Cool! I nver knew that he had this kind of life. Sad, happy, etc. He inspired me to love Science even more because at my 1st year of High School, one of my weaknesses is Science, along with Math. I then started to research about his life and his studies. I watched the movie over, and over, and over again. I even followed Eddie's other films like Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them, etc. It was so spectacular to make a movie just like that. A week before my final exam in 1st year High School, I studied and studied and studied. Of course especially at Science. In my head was like, 'Yes, Science! I learned everything for me! Thanks, Mr. Hawking! ' I also watched the movie, even tge behind the scenes. But the day after, as I was browsing the best side of YouTube, this videi showed up. 'The Final Words Of Stephen Hawking'. I was like, what? That couldn't be happening,right? I click on the video. It was said he dued on March 14th of 2018 (or something), tge exact day I studied for Science. I feel all of the things that are heavy weigh me down like an ant being weighed down by a huge rock. No. This can't be happening. How?! I feel like I loss so much power and life. On the day of the exam at Science, I couldn't forget what I've heard. But most importantly I can't forget what have he done to the society. He helped people who have difficulties ib understanding about space and time. I still can't believe that he is dead now. In fact, Stephen died like a hero. R. I. P.  Stephen Hawking. We love you all.ï»¿"

I'm in 9th grade and I have friend who is naive and childish for being overly enchanted in Christianity. He said Stephan Hawkins was his role model but when he died some told him he is the creator of the big bang theory. Freind proceeds in saying he's not his role moldel due to faith and shruggs off his death by saying god will forgive him for being foolish and accept him for his of over coming his obstacles. I sat there dumbfounded because he had no idea what it means to have a different point of view on the world and not everything is black-and-white for faith. Now I ask u comment section how should I face himï»¿

"Zameen Z I accept that science has not yet discovered everything. But I'm sure that it will. Who knew 300 years ago that one day we were going to discover the quantum mechanical model of the atom, and the wave nature of matter. These thoughts must have been bizarre at that time. But experiments point out again and again that fundamental particles behave both as particles and waves. Same with light. If someone was told 300 years ago that everything is made of small particles which are actually partially wave, he/she wouldn't have given a damn to such a bizarre concept. Similarly, today the idea of particles being created from nothing may sound bizarre, but it will be proved in the future, I guarantee that. Meanwhile, if you talk of a creator, that theory is full of loopholes and contradictions. The universe is complex, and if it had a creator, the creator must be even more complex. So even the creator must have a creator by your logic. And that creator must also have a creator... The chain never ends. All the organisms You see on Earth are a result of evolution. People ask for evidence of evolution. I ask them the evidence against evolution. Can't you see the gradual improvement in cell structure from bacteria to the first eukaryotes? The embryos of humans and fishes are identical, which indicates common ancestory at some point. I can't put this 100s of pages worth evidence in this comment. But wish I could.ï»¿"

"Sorry i dont want to waste anyone's time but I just need to share my story. Sometimes when I'm at school I like to separate myself from the rest of my class. Not by walking away but just by stop listening to the sounds around me and stop looking at the things around me. Normaly I look outside to the trees, the birds and the big , undiscovered sky above me.. but I didn't look at it two days ago. Two days ago I looked at a big poster on the wall for half an hour without looking away; 'The Theory of Everything' it said. I knew it was a movie before. But that day, two days ago I couldn't get my eyes of the poster. I looked Into eddies eyes, wandering away in my own thoughts. A few hours later, after dinner, I had to study for my math exam but I just couldn't stay focussed. My mind was with the poster and I felt like I had to watch it before continuing with my normal life. That night I couldn't sleep so I opened my window. I looked up and I had never seen a sky like that before. I saw more stars than ever before and they shined brighter than ever before. I started thinking: 'what is everything?' At that moment I opened my laptop and I put on this movie. I'll be honest with you all. I was very very touched. I laughed but I also had tears in my eyes because I was sad. Especially when I saw the scene where Jane said that she had loved Stephen, and Stephen started crying, I felt so bad. At that moment my phone vibrated, of course I didn't take a look at it because I was so focussed on the movie. But at the end, when I had just seen his life backwards. And the beautiful credit music started, I looked out my window again with the tears still in my eyes. Than I grabbed my phone and I saw this one pop up in my screen. 'Stephen Hawking passed away'. I was shocked. I was angry but. I was crying like a little baby. I changed. I wanted to go and live my life to it's fullest potential. I wanted to Discover the universe, and find the meaning of it all. Please, if you are still reading. Noting and noone can stop you from being the person that you want to be. Please, don't try to be popular and don't be afraid to be yourself. You can only find answers about life if you live how you want to live.Thanks, good luck. And rest in Peace Stephen âù_ï»¿"

"SimplyDiVine never give up! There's always something to live for. Even if it is such a small thing. Always follow your dreams and do what you like to do! I've got some passions that most people call nerdish or dumb. I tried to hide them for everyone in my class because i was scared of what people would think of me if they found out. Then i went to the shop to buy a cheap headset and i found out that there are a lot of people with the same passion. I was shy but a really nice girl asked me questions and made me talk more by doing so. Now i have a great group of friends. I can talk them about everything and i love it... sorry to personal again maybe. But i just want you and everybody else who is feeling bad in this society full of things and people that make you feel bad about yourself to know that there are always people that understand you. I'm very thankfull to everyone who responded to my story. Stay strong everyone, help each other and respect each other!

What a joke...Do you believe in that ? Did you died and again came to life?

"I'm not trying to personally attack anyone for their beliefs. But I believe that God does exist, and he does everything for a reason. Stephen was meant to die 2 years after his diagnosis.

:'(ï»¿
"God as we think of him doesn't exist, the image that religion has given of him is completely wrong, he is more like a governing force that keeps the universe together. We live, die and are born again in an infinite cycle because that's how things work. A big never-ending wheel . Hawking did great in this life, lived a long time and contributed to the evolution of mankind. You will meet him in his next life.ï»¿"

God already blessed him with countless miracles. Maybe it was time to go back to the universe.ï»¿
Stephen Hawking will always be one of the Greatest minds of all time.ï»¿
God makes the people that he love to suffer. And in the end they end up rewarded.ï»¿
"He doesn't make anyone do anything. That's just the way life works. We all have to go through trials that shape us as people. Think about it, if everyone was perfect and never got hurt and God always protected us, then we would all be like robots. Everything would be the same. God doesn't want that. He wants people to make their own choices and live their own lives. That's just the way i see it...ï»¿"
"Sizzox The truth, the evidence is there. It is ones perception of the unknown and love that brings God. Not trying to sound wise, like Stephen Hawking said, Human beings are ""dumb"", but faith is complex and so is our thoughts.ï»¿"
"Kira Brown Indeed. Bravo. God bless him and everyone on earth, because anything is possible.ï»¿"
aum deoli meeï»¿
"aum deoli God does exist, and what do you mean why does he do this? We were born to die and besides Hawkings never believed in God as I know of but God is the creator of this universe and Earth. God is real, science says it was the big bang but literally it was God, he created every single star and universe out there without God we are nothingï»¿"

aum deoli you know it's ironic when people in this comment section claims god exist but Stephen is an a theist himself :Pï»¿
I guess G-d wanted him to go back home tooï»¿
"guys, lets make this video hit 18 million!ï»¿"
XaB Peanut no one really knows what happens after death so you know whether heâ€™s right or wrongï»¿
Its just life cycleï»¿

"aum deoli god does exist and all these ""terrible"" things happen cause of man kind put it on it self after eve ate that fruit from the treeï»¿"
"Your all loving God planned this? Can't you see the irony here? If he's so loving, why did he make this great man suffer?""God makes the people that he love to suffer.

Kira Brown 50 decades? That's 50 x 10 which is 500 years. You and your religion about a guy that floats in the sky to spy on us is full of dumbasses who don't know shit. Our world is gonna become a world of dumbasses who nuke each other.ï»¿
He doesnâ€™t exist :(ï»¿
aum deoli he does these things cuz everyone should die in life.No one can live forever.God is real...ï»¿
butchoy00 everyone dies no one lives for ever.ï»¿
BigEvilToast IDK lets see how you gonna say that to god in judgement dayï»¿
"I don't think you're understandng the big picture here. God plans everyone's life just the way it should be and everything happens for a reason. I believe that God created Stephen with a health issue as a way to strengthen him. God also created Stephen as one of the most intelligent men on earth. Though he struggled, he outlived his estimated life span by 50 years! God does miraculous things... you don't have to believe everything i say, that's just my take on it.ï»¿"
"It was a typo, jeez. You don't have to attack people just because they don't have the same beliefs as you. And since you aren't aware, our world is already filled with dumbasses and it's not mainly because of christianity. I mean look at our president for God's sake.ï»¿"
And btw you think ALS is painless?God made him die so he wont feel pain anymore.You guys dont thinkï»¿
"God didn't do ""this"" aka death to us. It was a choice made by the first two human beings that were told not to do one simple thing because it will cause death. They did it any way. Rather than saying okay let's just start over with mankind and restart the human race with people who won't choose death...but no, God, in His' infinite wisdom and unfathomable love for His' creation (i.e. you), He sent God the Son to be born of human flesh and become part of His own creation. The Creator punished sin in the human body of the Creator so that the creation past, present, and future can be forgiven forever and live eternally with God and share in all His' glory just from believing and receiving through having faith. Simple. Yet, many resist this crazy concept because it makes no sense. They dont have all the answers and therefore do not want anything to do with God. As if being angry at Him solves anything or gets you anywhere. He wants everyone to receive what Jesus has done for them and have eternal life. Life on earth for now is hard but it is a vapor in the wind compared to eternity. It is so quick! We dont have much time down here. What matters is to learn to love others and let God love through you. The smallest kind act you do will be praised and awarded and noticed in Heaven. With all the garbage and filth and horrendous acts of violence and meanness going on in the Earth by people's own free choice...God notices the smallest acts of kindness. He notices the hand that is reaching out for Him. Who wants to know Him. Who wants to know the Truth in all these lies surrounding us. But it takes Faith to even come and reach out to God. And some people think it is stupid and feel foolish. It takes humility and a heart open to God. Not everyone can allow themselves to go there. But we all have until our last breath. God has known you forever. Trust when I say He loves you and approved you.ï»¿"

For Eddie Redmayne the role of Stephen Hawking has meant a lot to him in playing him in the Theory of everything but he is the first British actor to have played him and for him it was never easy to play him especially when he struggled to talk and therefore had used a talking computer to do the trick to communicate with people since he could no longer do so.ï»¿

Love can only go so far until it damages the individual's mental and emotional health. Although he kept his intelligence, fame and money, his capacity for emotional relationships was severely limited.I think we can all take something from this. This man was a wonderful man, who had everything taken away from him, just like that.Cherish the people in, have been, and will be in your life with all your heart. Live for them.

"Stephen HawkingThe interesting fact is that Stephen Hawking was born 8th January 1942 and I was born 8th January 1996, so Stephen Hawking is 54 years older than me. The date of his birth is also a 300th anniversary of the death of Galileo Galilei.Imagine how incredible he is. And Stephen Hawking has even the similar favourite topics as myself. Universe. Time, Space. Time-Space. Science. Technology...Of course when he is a scientist. And because he is not only a theoretical physicist, but also an author I consider him to be a polymath.I know that Stephen Hawking once said ,,People who boast about their IQs are stupid."" But I doubt that Stephen Hawking has IQ 160. Stephen Hawking has IQ from 160-180. And IQ 180 he should have only because his own uniqueness, exceptionality and remarkability.I wish Stephen Hawking an infinity, eternity of time, space, knowledge, love, joy, life, humour, stoicism, optimism, wisdom, peace, fame, glory... I would like to see him in 2042, when he will be 100 years old. I do believe he will achieve it.ï»¿"
This is so emotional! Long life Stephen !ï»¿
I also admire his wife! She was like 2 in 1 people!ï»¿
"God is the creator of this universe and man is honored by God with reason to search and learn in the kingdom of God SteveÂ Â  Hauken faulted the theory of existence and claimed that the human race of monkeys and we Muslims know the reality and purpose of existence and this lifeï»¿"

"Yuzuru Hanyu i am a strong christian, and i agree. Fred, i should re-consider what you said there, you should never wish death on anyone. The good christian thing to do now would be to appoligise and repent :)ï»¿"
"How very Christian of you. It's comments like this, from people like you, that make me a proud atheist.ï»¿"

I never actually finished it. I had put it on hold months ago since I kept cryingï»¿
This comment describes the situation like nothing elseï»¿
Fred Jaminson You represent such stupidity and lack of self awareness that it boggles the mind. I hope you someday take a step back and analyze your beliefsï»¿
In my case it's a movie that looks great in every way but you don't know anything about Steven Hawkingï»¿
animosity IV yes exactly why I havenâ€™t watched it although I want to so bad but Iâ€™m not ready for the barrage of emotions that will definitely come _Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜_ï»¿

"The theory of everything is the sun: the sun heats and heats up and by the action of sending out heat,it produces its own nucleus and builds pressure inside of it. And when the sun heats,it releases pressure from the nucleus to the shell/covering. These steps are called 'pulse of heat' (beating of heat emanating from the sun). Our hearts make pulses of heat; engines make pulses of heat; lamps make pulses of heat; batteries make pulses of heat. Everything that consumes energy,sends out pulses of heat! This is also the reason why you see the nucleus and rings that the sun pruduces everywhere in nature. For example, when you throw a stone into a body of water, at the place where the stone lands, we see the shape of a nucleus and the rings emanating outward from the nucleus. The form of all living things is also a core(heart) And a circle(covering/skin). The shape of a plant also contains a nucleus(of the plant seed) and an encircling(shell of the fruit or stem leaves of the flower. By jekaï»¿"

"Hawking is the perfect symbol for what science is today: crippled & speaking with an  artificial, mechanical voice.  He's the figure of trans-humanism made real which serves to underscore the entire fantasy of black holes of every size & type imaginable;  big bang expanding universes resulting from unobserved dark energy & dark matter; and, gravity waves claimed to be observed millions of light years away but never on the earth itself despite billions of dollars spent on LIGO experiments that have detected absolutely nothing.  Never mind that the mathematics behind the three types of big bang universes contradicts the four types of black hole universes which never match any of the big bang universes & contradict each other no matter the combination.On Youtube, see mathematician Steven Crothers at the Electric Universe conference destroy the mathematical inconsistencies & bogus assumptions (e.g. dividing by zero as an expression of infinity) of Hawking, Penrose, & Einstein, as well as, Dr. P. M. Robitaille's nullification of Kirchoff's Law on which the Planck constant is derived &, in turn,  on which Einstein's relatvity is derived, thus nullifying the claims of both Planck & Einstein.  Also, Robitaille shows how the so called background radiation of the big bang is nothing more than microwave radiation emitted from the oceans of the Earth.ï»¿"

">The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our timeLIEï»¿"
Leo Sousa who is the most brilliant and celebratet physicist of our time?ï»¿
"Define our time, define physicist, define celebratedï»¿"
The same definition you used to say that Stephen Hawking isn't the most celebrated physicist of our time. He is probably the most mainstream one though ï»¿
"""Our time"" implies anyone who was still alive until any moment between now and 30 years ago, because 30 years is the average age of people alive today; physicist is anyone who likes physics; celebrated is anyone with notable achievements in physics. So it's right to say Stephen Hawking isn't the one holding this prize. I don't know who is the most celebrated, but I know Stephen Hawking isn't him because you can quickly find other that surpass him. Even when i only consider physicists who were alive until the day this trailer was published, Stephen Hawking is not the greatest, and the problem of ""Who is the greatest physicist alive today"" is a hard one, but I can safely claim he isn't the one.ï»¿"
@Leo Sousa He is the most mainstream oneï»¿
"He is easily the most celebrated. Brilliant, maybe not. I'd say Edward Witten, probably but even then, physics and the rest of the sciences aren't in the hero worship days anymore. Everything is multidisciplinary and collaborative now.ï»¿"
"Is this LOVE STORY based on real facts, or they just added it to catch the atention and do the story more romantic?? Does he really have sons?ï»¿"
"It's a biography of Stephen Hawking. He has a family and wife. I suggest you look them up for the fact by fact story. Still this movie uses 99.99% facts. Dialogue i.e the exact words spoken, and the locations of the events are the only real changes to the true story of Mr.Hawking. Amazing true story.ï»¿"
"@Emlonknee and the wife also was intelligent? or there are parts just invented. I did not know on the other half of his story, and i would not like inventions to ruin it just cuz of money .tbhï»¿"
"@christian sozaÂ Please, your making me repeat myself. And honestly you look foolish asking if someone is intelligent. Still, for this second time I'll answer you.This movie was made to honor of the great genius of Stephen Hawking and the love he shared with his wife. It is the story of his life up in till his paralysis. MOSTLY everything is spot on and happened in real life just as the movie depicts. (events and decisions made)If you want to know every little discrepancy then I suggest you look them (The Hawkings) up and find out facts about them.Jane Wilde is an intelligent woman, just like every other person on the planet. Is she a super genius like Stephen? No, no one ever said she was and nether did this trailer imply that she was. The trailer clearly depicts the two talking about Stephen's theory of the universe and how they cared for each-other. Watch the trailer again.Ether way, this movie is a work of art and worth the watch.ï»¿"

@Julian Alberto that does not make her a bad person. She stood by him through so many years. Married him even though she knew about his condition. What person would do that? Eventually being a slave to his every need would cause them to drift apart. She will always love him but remaining with him did not make her happy. Don't judge someone because you're not half the person she isï»¿
"+Sabrina Fayee  - You said i quote "" Don't judge someone "" and then you said "" because you're not half the person she is "".I mean talk about self contradiction.You just judged someone with out even knowing them.Also you do not know Jane wilde hawking on a personal level to be defending her.There is no excuse, for either of their actions in their relationship.They both made choices they regretted it.You have no idea what is love is.You probably never felt a single ounce of love in your life.How do you like being judged ?ï»¿"

I'm confused, are you saying you want to have your cake and eat it, too? Because it sounds a little hypocritical what you just said.ï»¿"
Way to turn the conversation toxic...Jesus- not everyone is famous- thereâ€™s plenty of men who have taken care of their wives until the very end- havenâ€™t you watched the notebook? Shit like that happens every day.  Go to those places and volunteer.  See what love truly looks like.ï»¿

What do you mean?ï»¿
"they took theoretical calculations of a supposed ""black hole"" which has not been proven to exist, and they used that mainframe to invent the big bang theory. completely baseless, and blatant delusions right there.the asylum of the insane, can be found getting stuck inside their own world of made-up calculations.ï»¿"
"@Christ David Well yes, that's just how things are: When you try to solve the biggest questions on the edge of known things, then you will inevitably run into the situation that you have to build up theories based on less and less evidence and the probability of making mistakes grows exponentially. So a ""big bang theory"" is infinitely more fragile and likely to be only partially true or entirely false  than let's say evolution. Evolution similarly started out as a theory, but today we can safely accept it as a fact because of the immense and overwhelming evidence we have gathered in the last hundred years.So really the question is, do you have a better theory other than the big bang, which is supported my more evidence and working with it you can make more precise predictions about other yet unknown things?ï»¿"
"you know there is an anthropologist who refuted evolution outright, then explained a few major details of human history. if you did enough research, you would have already seen the lecture. so i grant it, your beliefs have made you lazy.ï»¿"
"@Christ David ""There is an anthropologist who refuted evolution""... Oh I see... I wonder why is that to every evolution denier there are a hundred professors why consider evolution as a fact.  I have been in conversations like this multiple times in the past. The one thing I have learned from them is that it's a lost case trying to come to a conclusion with these people. So I really don't want to waste your and my time, wish you all the best.ï»¿"

After all that she has done for him, i think that it was the only fair decision. not many girls would stay with you during such hard times as she did.. She deserved happiness too wherever or with whomever she would be so.ï»¿"

"Hey don't let this man lie to you he's holding back a lot of s*** to help him out. He won't even tell you what dark energy and dark matter is. Dark energy and Bob Hawking radiation are the same thing, when it slows down below 10 times the speed of light it becomes dark matter. They pissed him off when he gave the Cosmo expansion as C, but it has to be so. So I didn't finish it cuz he don't think they deserve it.ï»¿"
"So this is how it goes dark energy streams from black holes just like light does from the Sun( pay attention so you can understand Stephens equation for the cosmological constant) when it leaves black holes it is a tachyon that moves to the second reality( hyperspace) creating micro Micro wormholes they close after the tachyons decay into a neutral particle as they go below the speed of light. Becoming dark matter. Dark energy tries to seek its lowest point which is the event horizon of the universe, and the Sigma that halos certain types of galaxies.ï»¿"
"Take that class, tell em about it Stephen.ï»¿"
I'll put you this way if Stephen Hawking is wrong about his  cosmological constant I'll eat my hat. I don't know for sure if his model is the same model I see.ï»¿

"I know they loved each other so much, she accepts him and so does he, but at the end why he says sorry and they stay apart ? Can anyone explain to me, does he falls in love with the nurse ?ï»¿"
"""His mind changed our world. Her love changed his.""I think that's all the answer. The movie explain it all based the fact, ""Five years after their divorce, Stephen married one of his carers, Elaine Mason. Before the break-up, Jane had begun a relationship with a musician, Jonathan, who became her husband.""The nurse doesn't respect their family (esp Jane) and trying to get his (Stephen) attention which make her was desperate, didn't think could carry on him bcz she was so drained. By time as (I thought) he find she became sick because the situation being more complicated for her (since meet Jonathan). So he trying to solve it all by utilize it all as a boost to let her go found her happiness with another which (he knew) already growt in her heart. He actually forced to do it for her (and in case don't want to drag him too), that's why he cried and said sorry.I think he's not that fall in love with the nurse, he just takes her as carers and then he used to it until they get married.ï»¿"
He ends up marrying her. That's what bothered me. His first wife stayed with him even though it was super hard for her and then he decided to marry the other lady. They divorced shortly after though.ï»¿

+TheScytheMoron Gotta say both handicapped and crippled are pretty insulting words to use to describe the disabled. Have worked with a variety of disabled people who hate both terms. Just thought I'd point that out so you don't make the same mistake in future since I understand most people dont realise this is the case haha xï»¿
"@slime_pixieÂ I understand that ""crippled"" is insulting in this case and far away from the truth, but ""handicapped""? His illness IS a handicap. He cant walk, cant eat proerly, cant talk ... this sounds like a handicap to me! >_>""Disabled"" sounds WAY more insulting to me since, in my opinion. THIS somehow states that they are ""cripples"". Impaired would go well too, but I would never use the term ""disabled"".Â ï»¿"
"@TheScytheMoronÂ both disabled and impaired are generally medical terms wheras handicapped tends to be used to in a much more patronising demeaning tone, its even been considered a slur in the past. You may not find the term ""handicapped"" demeaning but I know a large amount of disabled people who do. Just typing ""is the word handicapped offensive? Into google comes up with immediate pages about wiping the word handicapped from the dictionary and changing the term ""handicapped parking space"" because it is indeed offensive (which has been done in the uk). My mother whos worked with people with both physical and mental disabilties for years retches at the word handicapped but shes quite passionate about it haha. Â Either way I would advise you dont use it mate.The term disabled isn't offensive btw and tends to be the go to word because it is the medical term, so just stick with that one in future i guess xOnce again, its understandable that you got it wrong, a lot of people doï»¿"
"Well maybe it is because I am not a native speaker. But from my Austrian (german language) point of view there is simply nothing wrong with handicapped. ^^But yeah ... I guess that's ""culture"". ^^ï»¿"

+Neo Alpha Ultra Man Theory of everything is also known as string theory which is trying to combine general relativity (law of gravity) and Quantum Mechanics (law of gravity but then for subatomic particles) into 1 theory/formula. It has nothing to to with god ...ï»¿
"+Neo Alpha Ultra Man I'm here to answer you and also to correct some of the previous comments.First of, space-science...? WTF is that? I mean, I don't want to sound disrespectful, but I never use words that i don't know what they mean, and so would have to do everybody.Second, I don't know why that is the title of the film, but I can tell you it has nothing to do with any scientific theory. I think that it's more about the meaning of the life itself, and since the life is everything, I suppose that's why they named it this way.Third, +Ramiro Gonzalez and +John Beton, there's no theory in physics or in science known or referred to as the theory of everything. What you're talking about, Ramiro, is the unified field theory, which is not finshed yet, in fact, it's almost not even begun, and it's not a tehory of everything. The purpose of this theory is to try to unify the four fundamental forces (gravity, electrodynamic force, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force). And John, the string theory is just one theory of the whole lot of theories that are trying to explain everything, so no, it's not called the theory of everything. There's not even a single string theory, there are a few of them. And by the way, I don't think the string theory is the correct one. I think that quantum field theory will result to be the only one correct.I hope to have helped. :)ï»¿"
"+Neo Alpha Ultra Man The &quot;theory of everything&quot; would be an equation which explains the entire universe. No one can get more specific because this equation has not been discovered yet.Stephen hawking is a cosmologist. This means that he looks for underlying rules of the universe. The reason he often appears in context with space (as in the area outside our atmosphere) is that a lot of cosmology can be studied only by looking into space. Black holes for instance have properties which can not be observed on earth (otherwise we would be in BIG trouble).Also, due to the universe expanding at around the speed of light (recent evidence points to this expansion being faster), we can &quot;look back in time&quot; and observe the universe in the past.There is a lot more to this, and I only know as much as pop-science literature and high school science teaches me.If you want to learn more about the topic look at quantum physics, string theory and relativity.About explaining away god: Yes, if such an equation were to be discovered, we could explain how the universe came to be the way it is now from the very beginning. We could explain EVERYTHING. Literally. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called theory of everything. This would make the concept of a creator obsolete, since there would be no more gaps in scientific understanding to be filled.And don&#39;t grammar nazi me to avoid dealing with the content of this comment.ï»¿"

"Honestly I thought I would've hated this movie being quite religious, but it never was in-your-face atheism.  And I'm glad. They focused more on Hawking's life dealing with ALS and his ultimate quest to find a mathematical solution for the Universe's creation. Funny how he had a religious wife though. It kinda saddened me that he left her in the 80s. But nonetheless, God is still present in ths movie whether Hawkings wanted to see it that way or not. Amazing movie guys!ï»¿"
"Some Dude Question...do you blame hawking for his atheism? Do you think he should have â€˜risen to the occasion that god gave him?â€™ Because he DID.  No one knows anotherâ€™s fate- you donâ€™t know how you would react if faced with the same disease.  Maybe you would have been left Alone.  Maybe you would move blamed god and stopped believing in him.  Maybe not.  The point is you donâ€™t know.  No one can blame another person for what they believe if they do not have the same eyes with which to see the world and the same set of circumstances.  Ironically, Stephen lived a life of hope and love- the way god would have intended.  So whoâ€™s to say if he hasnâ€™t been doing Godâ€™s work all along and he just doesnâ€™t know it? I have a feeling god is quite proud of Stephen, and planning a big party for him when he WALKS  through the gates.ï»¿"

Do not get me wrong Stephen Hawking has accomplished a lot of amazing things in his life (he's very brilliant) but watching this trailer makes me sad. Today due to the progression of the disease Stephen cannot even push himself in a wheelchair or talk more than a word a minute (due to lack of control in his hands). Also not only did his first marriage fail but his second one too. And to top it all off the poor man has difficulties breathing requiring a ventilator at all times. I complain about my own trials but I could never overcome the problems Stephen has if I were in his situation. I hate what he has and still goes through but my gosh is he my hero. He may not be a perfect man but he is a fighter!ï»¿
This movie is so beautiful.ï»¿

"I am so tired of atheists and christens trying to convert other people.All you do is argue and ultimately resort to violence that ends up with millions of people dead. The body-count of those put to the sword for believing or believing totals more deaths then all other reasons for killing in mass.Communism killed people who were harmless to everyone, because they liked to close their eyes and whisper. Then it killed many more because they refused to worship a man, even after declaring religion illegal. Church-states are no better, they torture and kill people for the same reasons. They censor people just as badly and they violate their own religions. So shut the fuck up. Red Faction, ISIS,  Conquistadors; those are the sick fucks that your fanatical brainwashed screaming promotes. I hope can sleep well knowing that.ï»¿"

"They can't prove it. Nobody can. They need to stop forcing their beliefs onto other religious people. Not all religious people are bad, I'm a catholic. This was a great movie and for atheists to ruin it for me by bashing religion because they somehow know how the universe started and are obviously like Stephen Hawking. Just ignore them, they'll go away somehow.ï»¿"
"@Sofia'sStuff Well, Creation says the Universe started at the behest of God....that he 'spoke' and it came into being. Look at the ""Big Bang Theory"". It basically states that the Universe suddenly and with no known reason exploded from an infinitesmally small pinpoint into the Uinverse we see now. It's just atheistic Creationism. With that they do not have to 'ponder' over the 'why' of Creation, and leaves everything to 'chance'. LOL.ï»¿"
"+Sofia'sStuff  And can you prove that God exists? No you canâ€™t. Imagine that we have a conversation one day and I say to you, ""Today I believe in the gerflagenflopple. You cannot prove that the gerflagenflopple does not exist, therefore it exists."" You can see that this is ridiculous. Just because I have invented something out of thin air does not mean that its non-existence is suddenly unprovable. There has to be some evidence, or some reason, that the gerflagenflopple exists in order to assert its existence. Since there is not, it is quite easy to say that the gerflagenflopple is imaginary until such evidence is provided.ï»¿"
"@Kim PetersenÂ Well that's my belief not yours. Nobody can prove how we were made or how the universe started, not even the smartest person in the world. No, I cannot prove God exists, but you can't prove he doesn't. I'm not trying to force my beliefs to you, just my opinion.ï»¿"
"@Sofia'sStuffÂ You are right, no one knows where life came from or how life started, a big misconception is that Evolution explains how life began is completely false, Evolution explains how life diversified (With evidence), that's it.You are right, no one knows how and why the universe started, the only thing we do know is that it did start. Just clear up misconceptions about the Big Bang, (I am assuming you haven't done any research on it) The Big Bang theory does not explain how or why the universe started, it only explains how and why space is expanding and many other cosmological things. The Big Bang does not exclude the existence of a God, neither does Evolution.ï»¿"
"@Kim PetersenÂ To me, I believe in God. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those extreme Christian freaks who force God into people, but that's just my belief. The universe is very complicated and I guess we will never know if God exists or not until death.ï»¿"
"+Sofia'sStuff But to them, if you have ANY belief in God you are a 'freak' or right wing bigot forcing your beliefs on others. Just mentioning it puts them into fits.  As for never knowing, well, that can be true, however, it takes nothing but faith and when we die, I'd much rather find out I was right than wrong. LOL.ï»¿"
@QuantumRiftÂ Some of them do that. Like literally you put God in a comment and all these random atheists pop out of nowhere asking for proof and hating.ï»¿
If there is a god prove it. Boom back it ya bitchï»¿
"+SweetAwesome22 You can''t prove the absence of something that doesn't exist, it is simply absent. That is what we call a positive claim, the claim that a god exists is a claim made by religious people, atheists don't pose a claim of their own, they don't claim an atheist god exists, they simply deny the existence of one based of the absolute lack of proof and reason. That is what we call rationality.ï»¿"
"I watched the movie as soon as it came out. Some real manly tears were shed that day. This has to be the most beautiful movie I have ever seen in my life. Till now I saw Stephen Hawking in documentaries and stuff talking science and shit. But after looking at what his personal life has been like, I have so much empathy for him.ï»¿"
theory of every thing is Awsomeï»¿
I really don't see the connection between atheism and this movie! (Mostly because I don't know what it means lol) Just enjoy the movie for goodness sake!ï»¿
"Hawking is a retard in a wheelchair, its the only reason he gets attention. He will burn in hell for all of his anti-Christ propaganda. I hate the freak and cant wait for him to die and face the God he has spent his pathetic life denying and insulting. Soon all his work will be proven wrong. Hes nothing but Satans little circus puppet!ï»¿"

"Jose Andres Flores Saavedra Without Jane (his ex-wife), Stephen's life would probably be very different now. Jane was the one who stood by his side through everything, she was there from the very beginning. Did you watch the movie? It's not about his ""love life"", it's about love, hope, time, life, how he overcame insermountable odds from the strength of his heart (_Ÿ’–) and with his beautiful mind(_Ÿ‘€_Ÿ‘“). _Ÿ˜„_Ÿ’–ï»¿"
Im sorry to do this but.. ..BLA BLA BLA ..yeha beatifull story like there are SOO MANY and many of them wont end up on divorce ..a love story that end ups like that is as interesting as the story of a racer that never won a single race.ï»¿

I have even cried a few times but I just feel like they should have never gotten a divorse and my heart aches for them getting divorced. And I can not get over this feeling. And again I love this movie and I'm happy that Jane and Stephen are still friends but I wish they could stay together forever. ï»¿"

I watched the movie but I did not get one part. Did his wife leave him in the end because he was to much to care for and because she loved Jonathan?ï»¿
"this adaptation is one of the best films i have ever seen. what a inspired film! the link between space and time in the universal is the connection among hope, passion, emphathy and love in real life no matter how hard situation seem like, as long as, we have a hope in ourselves, in people being around us.ï»¿"
"The movie is not about Stephen Hawking. It is, to a great extent. Had Stephen not been so good at cosmologist, none of us would have got to know about him. But it is also about Jane. The stubborn romantic who plunged into the relationship, took care of him and helped him do everything he loved.ï»¿"

"I have a question for all of you religious guys in here.Have you ever asked yourself, why do you need a religion? Why you need the existence of some god ?If there was an undisputable source of answers, and gave us the answer that god does not exist (any god, or anything you percieve or imagine as god), what would change in your life the exact next moment?Even in the course of thinking the answer the religion-defensing mechanism in your brain will kick in hard, but try to think it. Would you break something? Would you kick someone's ass because they fooled you? Would you do something that you wouldn't do now because of your religion?Try to elaborate it.Brainstorm on it. The answer to that question will give you a good insight to your current life.What you are lacking, what your phobias are, how much freedom you feel etc.P.S. If you would do any kind of ""bad"" or illegal things, that means that your religion has made you a lot of harm you know. And don't blame society or the priests, you have the blame.
