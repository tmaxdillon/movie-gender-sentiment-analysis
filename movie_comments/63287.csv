poker nerede amk•ÈÀ

"Ohhh poke her house, now i get it•ÈÀ"
What's the guitar solo  and piano song in this trailer ?•ÈÀ
"„„Ä_¼_¡ _À__„à_µ__„Ä _¡_____È_ü__„_¼_ü__ „â__, „ _______±„ä_µ _«„Ä„É____ ___µ _µ_±„Ä __ „à„Ô__ „â_¡__ ,_À__„à_µ__„Ä ___¡ „Û„Ä„„_¼____ „â__ ___µ_È„Î_á„•ÈÀ"
does anyone know the name of the song used in this trailer?•ÈÀ
"People may disagree with me. But, I think that this was Jennifer's best acting. The fact that she was only 16 or 17 at the time, makes it even more amazing.•ÈÀ"
Here for JLaw just realised that ChloÌÇ is also in it•ÈÀ
I Love this movie! Jen and ChloÌÇ are so awesome! And Jen is my role model too!!•ÈÀ
What happened with Bee and Cammie in real life?•ÈÀ
+_÷___¡__ _÷___¡______ Well if u mean like their real Hollywood life Chloe(Cammie) is quite famous but i don't know about Bee•ÈÀ
0•ÈÀ
"It's based of the directors childhood, but idk what happened to the other tow•ÈÀ"
I NEED the name of the song. It's so beautiful <3 if someone knows please tell me•ÈÀ
I have the same video do you thibk I can post this video???•ÈÀ
think•ÈÀ
"Wait, Petty was pimped out as a teen? How'd she escape and go to college?•ÈÀ"
This kills me every time _Ù÷_•ÈÀ
"I'm more scared than I have been in a long time. I have cancer. Doctors are making a joke of me. My parents have detached from me so as not to have to empathize with what is going on with me. I have failing organs and pills and doctors who don't care anymore and It feels like anything I may do is far too late and hell is waiting to swallow me up Just a little peace and mercy. Coldness, hate, violence are all I have gotten in response to please help. My father accused me saying, you just want us to be miserable with you. My mother said I was a creep and someone should punch my face in again and again until it is a mush. I never even spoke. They just assumed. The world is scary and the people in my life are insane and have never been able to wish me well, but in my suffering they remind me I am hated and unpardonable. Then they tell me to talk to Jesus.•ÈÀ"
"Mercy is a gift only the strong may give.Fight or die .I feel bad for you but I don't know who you are .I think you're going to find peace . Don't give up .•ÈÀ"
"That's nice of you to say. Btw the evil poured out on me is WHY the Docs ""white coats"" hate me. One asked how I was still alive with all the medications that they'd negligently tried to push on me and that was when I learned WHY one of them tried to riffle through my purse and call me up yelling threats about where I better come and what I better bring and do...Because THEY knew their actions were warranting a lawsuit and they needed to have their liscense stripped. I pray you meet better people than I have, but as for Mercy. That's up to fate and always has been unless it's something very much in someones control. in that case mercy (not pity) or disgust are the two options, and the person you grant mercy to or pour hate and disgust down on because of their life situation says nothing about them and everything about whether you retain your your worth. You're nice to be kind with your words and that's part of who who you are but it is appreciated still.•ÈÀ"
"aqualung- good times gonna come listen to it it might help you cope with your situation. i personnally think you should fight them. Poeple like you who have stared aat oblivion in the eyes know how precious the light is. dont let them take it away from you.i wont say ill pray for you im not religious.howeever i do belive that those who wait simply wait for nothing.keep walking no matter how much your feet bleed.one day for sur then you will reach your valhalabut fight for your home or they will burn it down•ÈÀ"
+mary sunshine I hope you get everything good just don't give up•ÈÀ
i wanna hear a recording of jen narrating the hunger games books.•ÈÀ
That would be great.•ÈÀ
"Some great quotes in this film, and powerful performances all round.•ÈÀ"
So this movie has nothing to do with poker? That's disappointing •ÈÀ
She lives in a poker house•ÈÀ
How is here for Chloe? XD?•ÈÀ
"Do you speak spanish? because you said ""How"" and is Who, but that doesnå«t have importance and the answer to your question is YES, im came here for she.•ÈÀ"
"Yup, me! Love chloÌÇ <3•ÈÀ"

"BakingAddiction101 the pimp raped her. I don't really remember if it was the mother's orders in order to ""make her a woman"" or if he did it on his own. Both horrible though. JL is amazing though very young in this film•ÈÀ"
