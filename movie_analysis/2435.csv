"No idea what this movie was about, wasted time...creatures with four arms, look already weird if had two.Ôªø"
i really enjoyed this movie when it came outÔªø
I need subscribersÔªø
Movie flopped because it was insane white messiah tames the native savages racist wish fulfillment garbage lolÔªø
"I can see why this bombed so horribly. There's just nothing intriguing about this trailer.
I tried watching it. It's as boring as watching paint dry.Ôªø"
the biggest mistake Disney makes is it title.by putting just John Carter it became like documentary or romantic comedy.it just too common.good movie by the way.Ôªø
Best moviesÔªø
I liked this movie a lot and watch it more than once a year. I don't know why it didn't do well in the box office?Ôªø
"Don't get it why critics ware so mad about it, because i really enjoyed the movie and would definitly go to see a sequel in cinemaÔªø"
"1/4 Billion USD and they can't get a descent mix between the music, sound effects and speaking parts. It seems that the more money spent, the worse the problem gets.Ôªø"
Love this movie the music the story i dont understeand why this great movie floppedÔªø
I'm shocked I'd never heard of this. Only learned of it because I'm watching the director's Ted talk right now...Ôªø
Loved this film. Far better than the Last Jedi.Ôªø
such a great film...Ôªø
i really really love this movie it's best movie owwwssmmmmÔªø
Lmao Tim RigginsÔªø
"Feel like watching Marvel movies..Oh ,it's disney work..never mindÔªø"
One of my top 10 movies. Too bad it didn't do better at the box-office.Ôªø
"The trailer makes the movie look a lot better(or different)than it is. Not that the movie is bad, but doesn't have this kind of feel, an certainly not this type of music..  They should do a remake or second 1 more like this..  Also they use the word ""Jedak"" too much, just sounds irritating.   ""Hello my Jedak, ooh ooh.Ôªø"
cool movie... one of my favorites. like the story. hope they make a second one. they got too! lol üëçüôèüò≠Ôªø
"john carter name make the movie flops princes of mars was 
better.Ôªø"
"good cast well made , horrible scriptÔªø"
similar to the¬†new wonder woman trailer..Ôªø
"Such an awesome movie, i rate this higher than 90% of the movies i have seen in the last decade. So captivating and enjoyable. Just an allround fun movie. The critics are on crackÔªø"
One of my all time favorite movies!Ôªø
lameÔªø
the reason this movie flopped was a trailer.Ôªø
I actually enjoyed this movie :/ The Sequal would've been even better :)Ôªø
Gambit :))))))Ôªø
"I really enjoyed that movie. Greatest advice to a young soul at the end: "" Take up a cause, fall in love, write a book.""Ôªø"
I loved third movieÔªø
If they use another planet instead of mars then i think!!! We know fucking mars we reached thier so use another planet another solar systemÔªø
"Kamran Ali You realize this is based on a novel from the 1910's, right? And plus, it's a space fantasy, not a straight up sci fi. Anything can happen.Ôªø"
so at the end he lived in Mars after diyng?Ôªø
"Speaking of the movie, it also reminds the video game Morrowind, due to the creatures and sandy landscape, mixed with The fall of the Roman Empire (1963) movie and Mass Effect SF soundtrack! ;)Ôªø"
"This scyf/peplum film adapted from Burroughs' books is a great movie! It is smart, beautiful, well-made, fun moments are cool, the costumes and the music too! The Tern people are mysterious, dialogues have philosophic issues, the battles are epic with great special effects! 
Director have done a great job creating a true strange, mythical world, with many civilisations and odd creatures. Really, this movie is probably one of the best Disney movie in the last 10 years. Indeed, some people can object that this movie is too complex for children. I agree with you. It is more for teenagers and adults. A shame the box-office was so bad.Ôªø"
TIM RIGGINS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
Very good movie and with some of the cast of Rome!!!Ôªø
I watched it for the first time last night and really enjoyed it.  Good movie!Ôªø
"the movie is excellent i have been waiting for the sequel.Disoppointed by hearing that Diseny is not willing to do so.Movie was great but diseny had failed to create a impact through trailer,it was not the fault of movie..Blood diseny debrie of loosersÔªø"
"Yeah, that movie was great! The trailer failed to inspire me to watch it also , but now I realize what i'd have lost if i didn't watch it.Ôªø"
honestly it wasnt that bad. the ending saved it and i actually want a second carter but i doubt theyll make another one if they want to take a gamble.Ôªø
Pretty dam good movieÔªø
"this movie is really good is¬†on level of Avatar, Stargate, even star wars. is a shame the people didn't go to cinemas.Ôªø"
Good movie!Ôªø
"Just because a movie doesn't earn huge box office sales, doesn't mean it's a bad movie! Sometimes really really high quality movies just don't make good sales. That's just life. This movie is great! Don't judge the movie on how much it made in theaters.Ôªø"
One of my all time favorites. Flop or no flop.Ôªø
such an underrated movieÔªø
AgreeÔªø
THIS MOVIE WAS DISNEY'S BIGGEST FLOP!!!Ôªø
it was a great movieÔªø
A great movie... and with Lynn Collins as a beautifully regal Dejah Thoris. I loved the books too.Ôªø
Mah childhood.Ôªø
"great movie n great story..
last 10 mnt omgÔªø"
Taylor's John Carter look reminds me of his Friday Night Lights character Tim Riggins... my God... he's devastatingly handsome... Watch Friday Night Lights if you haven't (eg. on 123Movies). His stares are so intense... what a heart-breaker...Ôªø
"Don't care much for this trailer, but the movie was great.Ôªø"
"R  C Nelson seriously? This trailer, with its hauntingly beautiful orchestral music (that pair nicely with the earth graveyard scenes) is exactly what drew me into wanting to see the movie so very much I saw it in the theatre.Ôªø"
Anyone know if they are making a sequal?Ôªø
"Number 1 - The movie bombed at the box office
Number 2 - Spoiler alert...




Didn't the main character die in the end?Ôªø"
"@Mark
It bombed because it opened the same week as Hunger Games. It still made 284.1¬†million¬† respectively and John Carter didn't die at the end he went back to mars.Ôªø"
"@LordSear1982¬†Oh I don't recall the ending, haven't seen it since back in 2012.
But I read something about the domestically being what the studio cares the most about so if a movie does poorly boxoffice number domestically it's considered a box office bomb. And John Carter only made around 70 million domesticallyÔªø"
no he didn't die in the endÔªø
"No wonder it flopped, all the trailers have a boring old rock song that doesnt fit the movie at all.Ôªø"
Rock song? When? And this movie was amazing...Ôªø
"+JPG- JackPlaysGames Not in the film, in the trailers.  I agree, the movie was great.  All of the trailers have a different rock song that doesn't fit the movie at all.  This one has a slow Peter Gabriel song, other trailers had Led Zeppelin, I think there was one with a Rolling Stones song too.  I don't know what they were going for with the music in the  trailers, but it should have had fun and adventurous score like the actual movie.Ôªø"
Great movie and seem subliminalÔªø
Alex Ander subliminal in what sense?Ôªø
I like the stupid dog thingy.......! cool flick!Ôªø
Mega zajebistyÔªø
One of the best movie I've ever watched :)Ôªø
"""John Carter"" didn't fail at the box office because it was a (lousy movie) as some may think. 

It opening on March 9, 2012 on 3749 screens domestically.  It had respectable returns of $30M for that first weekend. 

Trouble started on the second weekend (March 16th) when ticket sales were down 55%. and the third weekend (March 23rd) when ticket sales were down 62%. 

So what happened?  ""21 Jump Street"" opened on March 16th and then ""The Hunger Games"" on March 23rd.  Even ""21 Jump Street"" sales dropped 43% on the weekend ""The Hunger Games"" opened. 

It wasn't that ""John Carter"" was a bad movie, it's what it was up against on the second and third week that killed it.Ôªø"
that makes alot more sense. I was also questioning why this movie didn't make as much. thank you for your informationÔªø
Science killed this 100 yr old story.Ôªø
fuck science thenÔªø
Yeah it was a great movie and storyÔªø
great movie very underrated.Ôªø
better they send John cena to mars... wwe would be much betterÔªø
the best movie i ever seenÔªø
"Excelente pelicula, para los que crecimos viendo los comics y libros esta pelicula estuvo estupenda, ojala con deci: Ock, Ohem, Oktei, Wies, Barsoom pudieras ir a tu hogar¬°¬°¬°.Ôªø"
100 years after the book. Some have waited too long...Ôªø
"Nice movie, I wish the second episode.Ôªø"
this movie gave me chillzÔªø
"i really enjoyed to movie, got me to read the book too :D. Tho its sad to see it dint make as much as someof the others movies in the same genre. ¬†I hope more will come forward to make similar movies rather than stereotypical typesÔªø"
This movies was and still is amazing! It definitely doesn't deserve to be a flop! Wish we can get sequel..Ôªø
+Ais Makosi Wonderful movie.Ôªø
+Ais Makosi yeah the movie is great it gived me a strange felling...but i dont think we will ever se a sequelÔªø
Can't wait for this movie to come out!Ôªø
And next films com ?Ôªø
"This movie wasn't perfect, but it got a lot of shit it didn't deserve.Ôªø"
AWESOME SCI FI ADVENTUREÔªø
I like the story. ..This movie is beautiful! John Carter my dear friend and Superhero! Good Luck my friend! Ôªø

@Koen Keulen It's so funnyüòÄÔªø
"This movie is one of my favorites because it was WAY better than I thought it would be. The characters were likable, the CGI is good, and the plot was complex, but great. I loved the alien dog, it has humor to it, and I find it unique that there are different races and religions on Mars. That is pretty clever.(even though it's based on a book) The only reason why it was ""bad"" was because people kept comparing this to other movies. John Carter  is like the Superman of Mars. So screw the critics. Let them say what they like. I love this movie.Ôªø"
I loved the movie my name is donaldson Ha√ØtiÔªø
This trailer looks really epic and when I have seen this back in 2011 I had really high expectations. Sadly after seeing movie I was really dissapointed..Ôªø
"@jokerhateme why? How can you be disappointed with this movies, it's so great...Ôªø"
:)Ôªø
"I just watched this movie for the first time and freaking LOVED it!!! I really really hope someone has the balls to create jc2 in the future. I need more! I'm surprised and disappointed that it didn't do well in the box office and that critics thought it was bad, because I thought it was awesome!Ôªø"
SameÔªø
Loved it. If Disney hadn't blown the marketing this would have made it's money at the outset instead of over time via word of mouth.¬†Ôªø
"I was as skeptical as every other person, but this movie was pure fun.  I had this movie on my watchlist for about a year thinking it was not worth watching it I assure you John Carter you will enjoy.  Ôªø"
I thought the movie was better than the book.¬†Ôªø
Highly underrated movie. This was actually quite original.¬†Ôªø
"This was a love story where one man kills lots of people/aliens to bump uglies with a princess, a convient group of bad guys give him reasons to do so.Ôªø"
I still love his depiction in The league of extraordinary gentlemen 2. Probably one of the cleverest GN's ever written. Ever.Ôªø
ever.Ôªø
one of the best fiction ever !Ôªø
Song in the second half of the trailer?Ôªø
"Garth brooks, thunder rolls.Ôªø"
The song is called my body is a cage by peter gabriel :-)Ôªø
"Fundamentally, this is a good film. It doesn't deserve to be a box office bomb. I blame lousy advertizing. Hopefully, it can attain cult status.Ôªø"
the most important word in the summary was: INEXPLICABLY. this movie is so weird...i need to watch it.Ôªø
not a bad movie actually... but shows how important it is to pick the right cast... to be commercially successful.Ôªø
I quite liked this movie. Twist on the book version but good funÔªø
This film has a problem with just about everything. Even the first time he starts jumping about.The arcs are inconsistent. The animators needed to watch how a football acts with different trajectory. The horns guys with 4 arm needed more independent animation as well. Fight with white apes shows an arena with a specific length of chain that gets longer and longer. This must have been a huge waste of money for Disney. . . . . I like an odd story line if it has some connecting points to pull us in. . I would have to give this a 8 years or younger if public school is involved and the parents watch fox news. Dog like thing was the best actor.¬† Nailed all his lines.Ôªø
"it's on Mars, not earth.Ôªø"
@Seamus Mcgee I'm taking gravitational differences into account.. The arch is all wrong no matter what.Ôªø
I fartedÔªø
"Did you seriously just log into youtube, spend careful time to edit your comment and come up with witty jokes about the film, just to talk about continuity errors that persist in every single movie in the history of ever?....Ôªø"
@Zender Railen Not every movie has made these errors. People didn't do their job to sell the possibility of getting lost in the story because of these things. I could name the ones that did the work to accomplish this but those movies made money. This one didn't last a week except jokes about it lasted a month.Ôªø
fast 5 was garbageÔªø
"@Seamus Mcgee
The stories always weak on Fast.Ôªø"
"@Dale Bergeron
you must live a very very boring life if you can let something so minimal ruin the entire film for you. lol

god help you with the older james bond films xDÔªø"
I just dropped the largest duce everÔªø
@Seamus Mcgee Thanks for sharing.¬† Did you wash your hands yet?Ôªø
After I watch the rest of John CarterÔªø
 The movie was okÔªø
superman come from another planet and becom super on earth ... but john carter from earth go to mars and becom a superÔªø
Good movies...remain me of uÔªø
Trailer doesn't justify the movie one bit. The movie was Superb. Omg.Ôªø
"I liked prince of persia, will I like this?Ôªø"
"The movie is entertaining,I would say it is better than Prince of Persia,that movie was bad,as any other movies based from video games,with the exception of some.Ôªø"
Ye's you will like it. iÔªø
Good movie anyway!Ôªø
‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°Ôªø
"great move ,for me better then Avatar.I hope Disnay will make JC2:)
Ps:Princess who so fucking hot:)Ôªø"
"My thoughts exactly! Avatar= overrated crap, this is a very good movie and yes, the princess is efing sexy!Ôªø"
haha its never gonna happen it flopped so fricking hardÔªø
"What was the song in this trailer, please tell me!!!!???Ôªø"
"awsome movie , incredible ending¬†
dont listen to everybody try itÔªø"
john titor ? MAR ?Ôªø
Stupid shit for stupid shits.Ôªø
I thought it was an excellent film with very good actors. ¬†I would love to see the trilogy made if Andrew Stanton would direct it.Ôªø
It's suppose to be a trilogy? Gotta read the books then. I liked this movie a lot!Ôªø
"I am certain now, after watching this film, that the entire purpose of this movie was to butcher the original books it was supposedly drawn from.

Leave it to Disney to dumb down a classic story.

I would rather that they had made no movie at all than to make the stultified excuse for a movie that they did.

Disney has no shame.Ôªø"
"I never read the books, but loved the movie. I guess your expectations of it ruined it for you and my lack of knowledge about its roots let me enjoy it. Should I read the books though?Ôªø"
The books are superb - especially considering when they were written. Reading them will make it completely pellucid how bad the movie really is.Ôªø
"@Ash Jackson
omg i completely agree. The books are magical.¬† I honestly hated this movie because there was just so much they could have done with it if they had put an ounce of faithfulness to the original story.Ôªø"
"Books story : A
Films story B

observe them separately, and the film remains absolutely incredible, sometimes its better to keep to the original storyline, but it doesn't mean the new story itself sucks, this is and always will be a poor excuse to call a movie bad.

This is coming from someone who actually prefers original story lines to see a good sequel hopefully come from it, and i hate that this film seemingly failed because it is, really really good, it has more character than alot of the usual films that profit triple the likes of this.Ôªø"
"Ash Jackson Haha wow. I'm an English grad student, and even I just cringed at how ostensibly pretentious your comments sound.Ôªø"
So good! Cant believe people dont like it.Ôªø
Fake movieÔªø

It's a good movie.Ôªø

Shame as the most of people can't understand retrofuturism genre...Ôªø"
rETROFUTURISM?!Ôªø
"@Bryan Williams¬†Steam punk is an example of Retro-futurism if I understand it correctly. ¬†Like if something would have happened to technology of the 1800's early 1900's, like discovering we can use steam to power things and never make any improvements on it, and made the advanced devices with steam power. ¬† ¬†A brass and wood, steam powered computer. ¬†Lots of mechanical things driven by gears. ¬†Bio shock infinite, Steam punk, the spider bad guy in wild wild west. ¬†They all have Retro-futurism elements in them. ¬†Sorry if this sounds a little unorganized, I kept going back to clarify stuff.Ôªø"
#2 biggest movie flop of all time.¬†Ôªø
"Because of the movie I read from Princess of Mars to Chessmen of Mars.
Movie was 7.8 out of 10 for me. ok...8.2 if I rerun the Deja Thoris cuts again....:)Ôªø"
"I'm sure the new star wars movies wont be as good as this movie, those little kids acting will spoil the saga, in john carter you dont see a pretty teenager boy or girl destroying the film with the a cliche look or performance in general.....¬†Ôªø"
Anyone know what song is played in the trailer?Ôªø
Peter Gabriel My body is a Cage. There are two versions cut blended together in the trailer.Ôªø
Worst trailer ever no wonder the movie floppedÔªø
"i will make mars living i m in research for that, firstly i m making a space ship which will travel at less than the speed of light, we will reach on mars in seconds and all other planets like the speed of light without loosing mass!!!! and there i will insert some anaerobic bacteria then the algae afterwards trees and a lot of sufficient oxygen will be generated and we would definitely live there. see everything is possible in science the limitation is time which is too short. But personally i will not divide the area of mars in countries it will be open for all!then Jupiter,Saturn...... i m 16 years old but i will show u some day....Ôªø"
this was movie was AWESOME!!! I wish it did better in the box office.Ôªø
I think the same way :)Ôªø
So do I.Ôªø
Stargate+Treasure Planet+Cowboys vs Aliens=John CaterÔªø
The best Part of the movie is it's Poster (Man dragging two elephant size gorilla or something. Really epic)Ôªø
I liked this movie. I believe it could have been so much better tho. Im gonna read the books since they won't be doing a sequel...sigh.Ôªø
"What about the music in the teaser...
Anybody that know what song that is?Ôªø"
Such an underrated film.Ôªø
"this movie was one of the most expensive movies of all time, $250 million. crazy specially after seeing the movie which was... okayÔªø"
"I actually enjoyed the movie that i watched it twice. 
Ôªø"
OMGOMGOMG THIS FILM HAD SO MUCH VISUAL WORK PUT INTO IT i was so sad over the final product...Ôªø
"After reading the books, I'm realizing this movie could have been done so much better, and it's dissapointing to me.Ôªø"
am about to buy the books due to this movie so they couldn't of done that badÔªø
"I'm not saying that the movie was bad per say. It's just the books bring so much more to it, as do most books, and the movie just doesn't capture it as well as it could've. I did enjoy the movie nonetheless.Ôªø"
"@EnderCreepGaming
i enjoyed it more than the books. there's alot of plotholes and contrived coincidences in those stories, completely unbelievable stuff, even for a 'fantasy' story. the movie had a nice tight plot.Ôªø"

"Horrible marketing aside, I think many people can't handle the idea that civilization may have began on Mars as opposed to Earth.Ôªø"
I really enjoyed this movie. Definitely in my top 50! Ôªø
"Why the fuck did this movie bomb? It was awesome! Great acting, great plot, great script, great special effect, great music, etc. I love how it had a good balance of everything: action, romance, drama, twists, comedy. Too many action/scifi/fantacy movies now are pretty much just one action sequence after another with minimal plot, a hot girl, and some one liners here and there to lighten it up.Ôªø"
I thought it was an incredible movie but for some reason it did not show up in our local theaters. ¬†It was like a conspiracy against the movie. ¬†I just watched it last night on Spike TV. ¬†I am irritated that Spike TV put it on at a poor time. and then they ran so many commercials that it was testing my patience. ¬†The movie started at 10:00 p.m. and did not finish until 1:00 a.m. ¬†I only stuck it out because it was such a good movie. ¬†Disney got a bad rap for this movie. ¬†Bottom line if you like Science Fiction adventure movies this would be one to rent.Ôªø
"amazing movie,one of my ¬†favs!Ôªø"
"the only reason to give a bad review on this movie is to be one of the people who gave a bad review otherwise i thought it was great, very entertaining and i liked the ending tooÔªø"
This movie was magically scientifically awesome! I mean just imagine if this movie was true! What we are some super humans in other planets!Ôªø
Amazing movie. As long as you have half a brain and you can follow the complex story you will like it. Unfortunately poor marketing doomed this one. I hope they eventually make the sequel.Ôªø
I found it cheesy but still a fun watch. Doesn't require brain at all.Ôªø
It was supposed to be a trilogy. But it's one of the biggest flops in history. 6th most expensive movie ever.Ôªø
Biggest flop in history and I enjoyed it...whatever!Ôªø
"biggest flop must be Kingdom of Heaven,cost about 130 million to make,only grossed 47 million US dollars. Have done better on DVD though,so it`s gaining some ground,but still. :PÔªø"
"one of my foavirte movie is eragon ,no knows this movie XDÔªø"
I know it.dragons and shit right? :)Ôªø
yaa haha dragons are the bestÔªø
@ebbhead20¬†this costed 250-300 dollars and grossed 73....Ôªø
@ebbhead20¬†Kingdom of Heaven made 243 million world wide. So what's your point?? Almost the double of the budgetÔªø
Not what i read ? Ôªø
@ebbhead20¬†Actually I made a mistake. It was 211million. Go check boxoffice mojoÔªø
"was really bad in some places.. &surprisingly good in others but definitely better than the marketing it received which was incredibly low key for a Disney backed film 

They banked on the success coming from fans of the book aka the twilight saga &LOTR before it only the latter had far superior marketing &the former was a staple of mindless teens &fresh in the collective memories whereas JC was written in 1902 when slavery was barely abolished so fans of it tend to be sparse and the material is highly derivative to non readers on some parts

Overall Taylor ""unluckiest actor aluce"" kitsch did a good job with an average script carved from classic material stuffed into strange cgi &bad advertising/timing... Shame rilly co he's a good actorÔªø"
and the first John Carter story came out in 1912 so just had 100 years aniversary in 2012. :)Ôªø
"love this movie,better than any of the Star Wars prequels,and also one of the best action adventure flicks i`ve seen,so screw the bad press. Great design,great characters,best cgi beasts i`ve ever seen,hope they do more in the same style,but that might not happen after the hammering it got. :(Ôªø"
This was a brilliant movie. it's worth a watch. Don't beleive all the other comments. It gives you all the information you need to eventually understand. He does fight but for love. Survival and such. There are reasons unlike what most comments seem to mention.Ôªø
Why did I NOT see this being advertised in 2012? Maybe that's why it flopped?! I mean If I knew about it I'd have been so excited to see it! It's my kinda film. It's epic. And if Twilight was the cause Imma be so mad.Ôªø
"best fucking movie, what the fuck are u cunts talking about!! fucking wackos!?Ôªø"
Great movie and it flopped because of poor marketing and the name was confusing. Movie that needs to be seen a couple times to appreciate all the players and significance in our world. The archons are portrayed in this movie.Ôªø

"I really liked the movie , i don't know why people didn't ...Ôªø"
"For all who are completely uneducated about this: JOHN CARTER was a book in the Barsoom Series, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs back in the 1910s-1920s published in the newspaper and magazine and eventually collected into books. They didn't ""know"" much about Mars, but Science Fiction isn't suppose to be real. So, Ryan Delaney, unfortunately it's not just a stupid movie. This is one of the grandfathers of the Science Fiction genre. Burroughs thought up the idea of ""ships sailing on light"" before solar power was even invented. That's genius.¬†
The only reason the film didn't do well was because Disney assumed people were educated about science fiction and new the Barsoom series. Though obviously not, if people are saying as stupid of things as you.Ôªø"
I'm pretty sure this falls into the category of Science Fantasy than it does Science Fiction.Ôªø

To those who didnt know.. this movie was the biggest office flop in history. with a net loss of 166.5 million dollars. The more you know.Ôªø
"yeah its walt disney, they dont rly care, looks like they have enough money alrdyÔªø"
"From Wikipedia: ""to a loss of $84 million""
It does say that there were speculations of a loss of about $100-150 million, however it did make more money in areas outside of North America, particularly in China and Russia and the CIS countries. So the loss is smaller than $100-150 million.
What's your source for the net loss of $166.5 million? It seems very precise, and yet it's contradicting Wikipedia.Ôªø"
"i have this app on my phone and i stumbled upon this video so i just decided to say it. but i aint surprised that app has been wrong a few times. its called ""wtffacts""`Ôªø"
"Ahh, okay. It's not that it's plain out wrong, it's more unprecise :D
Now you know that Disney didn't lose THAT much money, but still 50% of what the app told you :)Ôªø"
"The floppest film of the history, or should we say biggest bom box office is Mars needs Moms. You can see it on wikipediaÔªø"
@joao barata what about A troll in Central Park?Ôªø
"@joao barata
I thought cut throat island was the biggest flop in history.Ôªø"
"@Blastaar7¬†Man, if you, and your friend who¬†awesered above you don¬¥t have education, well not my fault. I was simply exposing facts, if you want to be stupid its your problemÔªø"
"@joao barata
¬†I'm stupid and don't have an education because I read, somewhere, that cutthroat island was the biggest flop in history? The fuck is wrong with you kid? You get offended over nothing and start hurling insults? A simple response could've been ""oh it was until john carter came out"". Work on your interaction skills.Ôªø"
"@Blastaar7¬†The fact that you said ""I thought... was the biggest flop"" says it all. You don't even say it's the biggest flop, just that you THOUGHT it was.¬†Don't mind that guy, he must be a total dick..Ôªø"
"What do you mean a book , it's just a stupid movie that some director didn't even try on and he just wanted money if it and plus I've seen the movie and it sucked and once again there's no point to the movie, the guy is first on earth then he wakes up on mars for no reason and starts to battle shit, the movie probably got no stars and no good ratingsÔªø"
It was a book written in 1902 one of the first scifi stories ever created.¬†Ôªø
"This movie was fucking amazing. 10/10 best.
Good thing the trailer did not spoil anything.Ôªø"
What the hell is the point of this movie??Ôªø
a book weirdoÔªø
"@Albert The Hun
 because it wasn't true to the source material. Yet again. It was ok, but it could've been a brilliant epic, if the studio didn't puss out.Ôªø"
"@Albert The Hun
Same here.Ôªø"
What's the point of any movie?¬†Ôªø
why the fuck would disney want one of their own films to flop at the box office?Ôªø

what is the name of the song from the trailer?Ôªø

this is the BEST MOVIE! I HOPE THEY MAKE A PART 2!Ôªø
10/10 to john carter.....and lynn collins...she is so awesomeÔªø
"They can't make a sequel without any traction; they've already missed the opportunity. 

Ôªø"
"You know this movie lost 200 million of it's 250 million dollar budget... so yeah sorry but no part two... EVAR...
Ôªø"
Film is awesome I really hope a second is madeÔªø
"ok the movie is great i just don't why the words to bring back home are so like atcient
Ôªø"
The trailer is generic as hell. Is the movie actually something unique?Ôªø
"Lorax, Avengers and Hunger games. That's why it failedÔªø"
"it lost a lot of money, that's why they are reluctant to make JC 2. sure it made like 300 Million but it needed to make 600 million just to break even because it was so expensive.   The  film only got mixed reviews. And that's not a good sign for the first film in a series when in general, the first film in a series is usually the best film.  They should have never released the film the time they did. It had to compete directly with Lorax, Avengers and Hunger games. That's a lot of competition. Ôªø"
"Dude, it's boring. The original books are fun, but even they aren't THAT great,Ôªø"
It was a great movie! It's because of the trailerÔªø
he is so hotÔªø
I have no idea why this film failed at the box office. It was a very good film. Ôªø
"Very very good movie! I will be honest, when It first came on i was alittle like ""-_- .... hm""... lol.. but honestly it didnt take long for me to be on the edge of my seat and into the characters of the story etc. Loved it!! Best movie ive seen in quite awhile to be honest! And yea... a part 2 would be awesome. So i see it happening though? I dunno.... Ôªø"
wow... it was two yeard ago.. times flies so fastÔªø
"Really underrated movie, too bad it didn't do better. Also, this is still one of my favourite trailers of all time.Ôªø"
Tim Riggins!!!Ôªø
"bullshit
Ôªø"
"great trailer, very bad movie.Ôªø"
"It did flop at the cinema so it probably won't happen, at least for a decade or so.Ôªø"
Sure hope it gets a sequel.Ôªø
"Actually, they didn't include the OF MARS part because the director wanted to appeal to a larger audience, also because recent (at the time this was made) movies with the word ""mars"" in the title had done very bad at the box office. eg. Mars Needs Moms, etc. Well, turns out this was one of the biggest box office flop s in movie history. Ironic.Ôªø"
One of the biggest bombs in historyÔªø
This movie made me want to read the sequels! I love itÔªø
"Avatar = entertaining spectacle, Hunger Games = okay but trite, Avengers = surprisingly good for a super hero movie, Prometheus = Beyond stupid and self-contradictingÔªø"
ahahaha that made my afternoon. xDÔªø
"This movie should be in the same rank as Avatar,Hunger Games,Avengers Prometheus or any other High Budget - quality movie...Ôªø"
"This film was actually quite good. The trailer really, really, really doesn't do it justice. Real bad luck that it game at the same time as Hunger Games and Avengers though. I hadn't even heard of it until I read a list of 2012 films out of boredom. 
Worth watching ;D Ôªø"
Was it good?Ôªø
Barsoom for life!Ôªø
Hail Helium! Hail Barsoom! Hail space cocaine! Aaargh!Ôªø
AMAZING MOVIE!! JUST BRILLIANT!!  DISNEY NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE ME :) Ôªø
JOHN CARTER SUCKS MAYJOR BALLS SO FUCKING BORING the begining was interesting but the rest sucked.Ôªø
Does anyone knows will there be a part 2?Ôªø
Thanks all.Ôªø
"There's actually a book written as to why this tanked so bad, which was primarily due to a mix of the marketing and budgetary needs/choices by Stanton, the director. You should check the book out if you really do want to learn more about it, it's pretty good.Ôªø"
"And 100 years later Mars is devoid of life, good job, John...Ôªø"
dont like walt disney movie scenario Ôªø
"Awsome, awsome movie. 10/10. Havent seen anything like this since star wars.Ôªø"
I love how they used blue blood so that it looked gory but still pg 13 good DisneyÔªø
This movie was actually good about 8 stars goodÔªø
give the guy a shirt and i'll watch the movie.Ôªø
"I have to respond to this movie just for the sake of giving credit. This was a great movie. Why it bombed at the Box Office seems almost on intentional. Perhaps Disney doesn't want to have John Carter and now Stars Wars in the works as well b/c of the similarity and potential competition within Disney. But hey, truth be told, George Lucas's Star Wars was inspired by Lucas reading ""the Princess of Mars"" or John Carter, at least in part.Ôªø"
"Just watched it......great movie, best I've seen for some time. Can't believe it bombed as bad as it did...only marketing can be blamed for that cos this really is a very good film. Shame...hope there's a sequel :-)Ôªø"
its alot of fun to watch .. .and watchable again and again ..  it only flopped at the box office.. coz disney wanted it to... no other reason... and the critics that put this flick down are the kind of critics that masterbate at night and blame it on their grade one teachersÔªø
The part at the end where e is sent back to earth is like when you wake up from an amazing dream... The feeeelaÔªø
dont trust either. i never did and never will trust IMDB. everyone has different tastes. just becase some group of people say its good or bad doesnt mean that opinion represents everyone. make your own judgement after watching :)Ôªø
"to lennon..boxoffice supports what he is saying, and boxofficemojo is the official web to know what movies grossed..Ôªø"
"yeah, this is really fantastic. Listen to this, i really didn't expect that this site would send me a check of $240 for doing some surveys. its worth a try here: bit.ly\13ZFjJXÔªø"
IMDB figures are contradictivly different than yours. :D who should i trust..Ôªø
"I believe the budget for this film was 350 Million, it brought in 150 million at the box office.  That is a 200 million dollar loss on this film, the Disney executive who approved of this film retired after this tanked.  Or so i've heard but it honestly looks like a pretty good movie I don't see why it did so bad.Ôªø"
This was the story that inspired the creation of Superman. I'm glad they finally made a movie out of it.Ôªø
"can anyone please tell me another movie that is alot like john carter. i really enjoyed it and i wat to watch another film a bit simular to this one. so can anyone please tell me if you know any, apart from avatar ive seen that.Ôªø"
Soon too be 7!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
I have read the entire series several times. I liked them all except for the last book which seemed like a money grab since it wasn't near as good as the rest of them.Ôªø
"I dont get why all those critics went as far as calling this movie ""horrible"", ""biggest flop of the summer"" e.t.c. I think its a great movie and a job well done by whoever made it. Oh well...guess there must be some form of politics in the movie industry i am yet to understand.Ôªø"
Didnt :(Ôªø
I wholeheartedly agree with everyone that liked this.  Great movie!  I don't care about scientific plot holes or any nonsense like that.  The key here is I believed and it is and always will be a treasured memory for me.Ôªø
A box bomb? Like it made a lot of money or didn't?Ôªø
"Tell you what , disney did a bloody good job with this film!Ôªø"
apparently this movie was such a huge flop that disney ceo had to resign over the loss they made by making this movieÔªø
free free naicÔªø
"Don't you understand that this story was written over 100 years ago by none other than Edgar Rice Burroughs?

There's no way that this ripped off Planet of the Apes, or Avatar, or Star Wars - hell, the creators of those stories weren't even BORN when this was written.Ôªø"
that moment when on 144p quality starts lagging....you know you should have stop downloading torrentsÔªø
"no, this trailer is good. the one from tv commercial is what turned most of the audience away, which is funny because from what i remember it tried to sell as an action film like you wanted it to be. this one showcases more emotions with a deeper storyline, which is truer to the nature of the movie.Ôªø"
"horseshit trailers like this one probably was a major contribution to the terrific film being distanced by the public.  A lonely piano with a tom waits impersonator singing???  The film was all action, with excellent sfx and the a story ev-er-re-bo-dy has read!  Making it look like a downer did it in totally.Ôªø"
This movie was so good. Why did it fail? WHY!?!?!Ôªø
"epic...just briliant movie , one of best i have ever watchedÔªø"
"Man, I really truly feel bad over the fact that this movie didn't do better..Ôªø"
"Eh.. Actually, not a single bit like it.Ôªø"
Is it me or is the story a BIT like James Cameron AvatarÔªø
amazing this movieÔªø
This movie is really amazing :)Ôªø
Lynn CollinsÔªø
Yeah. If you love Mars fiction you should totally read them.Ôªø
"That's cool, I'm mainly interested in getting more detail from the story. I'm a big fan of Mars in fiction so as long as the fundamentals are there, I don't mind.Ôªø"
"I warn you, the books are very different than the movie. They are great though.Ôªø"
Damn. I'm gonna have to get the books. Doesn't look like they're gonna do a sequel unfortunately.Ôªø
I think it was about the same amount of time as EarthÔªø
"How much time had passed on Barsoom? 'cause on Earth, 10 years passed..Ôªø"
"Not a great movie, but defiantly fun. Should of stayed truer to the book though.Ôªø"
"He eventually finds her. But first him, Tars Tarkas, and his son must go get her back from The Black Pirates of Barsoom.Ôªø"
Gambit ruined his career...Ôªø
it was a ridicilous kids movieÔªø
Part 2!?!?!?! Please!Ôªø
ha ha oopsÔªø
ive read this book a hundred times and nver get tired of it...wow i never expected (when i first pictured john carter in my mind) that he'll be smoking hot!Ôªø
That was John Conner.. lolÔªø
John Carter from Terminator?Ôªø
Realy great movie.....worth watching..Ôªø
0:41 his hair is on fire!Ôªø
0:37 Olivia Wilde?Ôªø
"I rented to movie. And liked it very much, it was great. more then pretty pictures and cgi but great characters and story.Ôªø"
Canceled.Ôªø
One of the best movies i've ever seenÔªø
Barsoom series. The first one is A princess of Mars.Ôªø
Tim Riggins!!Ôªø
"I'm not such a book reader, but i'm reading only adventures, this is sci-fi + adventure can you tell me the name of the book? Or its same name?Ôªø"
I liked it.Ôªø
Yes! I like underground races with cars but i dont think they deserved 6 or 7 movies. Max was 3 movies with that...Ôªø
"I heard this movie didn't do well in theaters, which probably means it's really GOOD! I'm excited to see it, too bad I didn't hear about it til now.Ôªø"
"if they can make 6 fast n furious movies, I think they can make 2 John Carter films Ôªø"
THIS MOVIE IS AMAZINGÔªø
"I thought it was Timothy Olyphant lol
Ôªø"
I don't understand how this wasn't the best selling movie of 2012! the ending was so witty i loved every second of it. Ôªø
"Everyone google the petition to ask Disney to make a sequel, its really small now but if everyone goes and signs it can be huge!! I signed, you can even request to not have your signature be public. It requires very little info and doesn't spam you. Please do this!! I want a sequel!
Ôªø"
I enjoyed this film.Ôªø
This movie...Ôªø
i watched this last nite on acid tabs... this is a fuckin good movie watching it sober now to try and make sense of it hahahÔªø
Because you got no taste!Ôªø
I totally agree. People can't think for themselves. They get brainwashed so easily! Pathetic! Ôªø
Flash Gordon would be having John Carter waxing his ship!  Flash....FLASH!Ôªø
the biggest bomb in historyÔªø
BEST FILM EVER!Ôªø
JOHN CARTER 2 ? Ôªø
"No, I've read, the fact that it's just titled John Carter, most people have no ideas what it's about.Ôªø"
LOL you don't read much? The movie is named after the book-John Carter of Mars.. One of a series of books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the 1930's i believe... Ôªø
"It flopped because of the dumb ass titles, and the dumb ass director decide what to put in the trailer, failing to mention himself, the book, or anything that's remotely interesting. It flopped because Disney gave this asshole director complete artistic freedom.Ôªø"
I love the music what is it?Ôªø
"lol,you have just proven my point. That most people are lemmings and buy movie critics reviews hook,line and sinker. You are the perfect example of a lemming,sir!Ôªø"
"This movie 'flopped' because most people are lemmings who believe movie critics and can't think for themselves.Most people told me --- 'oh,im not going to waste my money because i heard it was a flop'.. sad.. this was a magnificent movie. Ôªø"
insanity. i loved the poop out of this.Ôªø
"this movie could've been really really good, but there were tons of plotholes, the plot itself wasnt that interesting. it's like John Carter himself becomes an ordinary dude instead of a guy from early American history, they could've made his character much much more interesting. I wanted to love the movie but was constantly disappointed by almost everythingÔªø"
"to much 4 disney
Ôªø"
 JOHN CARTER 2  2014 Ôªø
I see nothing but positive reviews in the comments but I dont think lve ever even seen a commercial for this movie. Looks pretty interesting.Ôªø
"One of the worst movies ive ever seen, so much money wasted for nothing. Ôªø"
from myperspective theres nothing wrong with john cater disney should have made money off this its as good as star wars.Ôªø
sadly they canceled it for finding nemo 2. I know man.Ôªø
"Disney is so stupid, stupid, stupid.  I just watched this movie and it was awesome, yet somehow I never even heard of it.  Talk about a marketing failure.  And what were they thinking with this lame song they put in the trailer.  It doesn't fit the movie at all.  It makes it look boring.  How do you spend $250,000,000 on a film and have it turn out good, only to drive it into the ground marketing wise.  Way to drop the ball.Ôªø"
Came for Heisenberg and stayed for the gorgeous girl :PÔªø
"I saw the movie the day it came out in theaters, sad it do as well as it could of done. It was a great movie.Ôªø"
This was a GREAT movie.. It is a shame more people didn't see it at the theatre my self included.. Would have loved to see the sequel... Makes me sad that it most likely won't happen...Ôªø
BRILLIANT film!! Can't believe I didn't seen it before. Maybe it should be more advertised. LOVE IT!!  Ôªø
Never say never againÔªø
I liked this movieÔªø
This movie was so f*cking awesome as the books are! I heard somewhere that there will be a sequel even though it was a box bomb... They said that Barsoom books deserve a movie. I hope they will make more...Ôªø
Shiiiiit good movieÔªø
My band directed made this movie and his name is John carter he plays tubaÔªø
"booooooooooo......... im using this for a movie commentary :) its gonna be hilarious
ive already written it

Violet is in the spectrum of purple.Ôªø
"Most violets we see are not blue. They are violet or some form of purple, but there are also blue ones. I did not say that all violets aren't blue. I was using a general perspective.Ôªø"
"violets are actually violet, hence the name.Ôªø"
"Don't be fooled by the name. There are many types of blue violets. Your rhyme is clever, but wrong.Ôªø"
"there isnt going to be a second one, the film bombedÔªø"
sadly they canceled it  for Finding Nemo 2. Ôªø
"The Burroughs books are what influenced avatar, and starwars and prob just about every sci-fi fantasy after them...the books are brilliant.Ôªø"
"it is known Khalessi 
It is kwon...Ôªø"
"I think this film, more better than avatarÔªø"
A really good movie! i hope it will make a second one!Ôªø
then why did it bomb?Ôªø

"Our newest song, ""The Escape of the Dead"" is based on the events of this movie and the original novel ""A Princess of Mars"". Way under-rated movie!! Ôªø"
:DDDDDDDD FINISHED WATCHING WOOLA XDÔªø
Que pasaÔªø
Hey thats me!!!Ôªø
HOLLWOOOD is just shittt they make part 1-2-3-4 of rabbit or rings or shit or bullshit but nottt part to of JOHN CARTER Ôªø
"That's what i meant by ""maybe we have seen it all in Star Wars Movies"" and now John Carter as a movie brings nothing new to the table. The Novel can be older than Star Wars ""which i didn't know until you told me"" but the movie isn't up to standards at least mine. There is no depth in the acting or the script. It is bound to be compared to Star Wars unfortunately. I was very excited when i say the trailer and posters but really disappointed with the movie.  Ôªø"
"Yeah, sorry that was supposed to be Star Wars, not Star Trek. But I can`t understand how you can`t realise that the John Carter novels were written way before the Star Wars movies were even thought of. It cannot possibly be a Star Wars wannabe because the John Carter novels precede the Star Wars movies. Now I`m not denying that the Star Wars movies are better, but you can`t say it`s a Star Wars wannabe when the original idea for John carter was written well before Star Wars.Ôªø"
it's just the movie is freaking wrong. When it starts i just felt something was wrong. Wrong actors or just bad acting.. I'm normally very open to movies and willing to give every one of them a shot but this one John Carter was bad all the way. Maybe its because we'v seen it all in Star Wars... but its not even near Star Wars though. Ôªø
"I do not know what star trek has to to with this, but i just looked up on google and i was spot on. John Carter is a wanabe Star Wars. Loads of critics says the same.Ôªø"
I`m sorry how can it be a wannabe Star Wars movie when the fucking novels were written way before star trek even existed?Ôªø
BIG LOL. it's a wanabe Star Wars movie. Your taste in movie must be horrible i am sorry to say thatÔªø
google john carter sequel petition!!Ôªø
I urge everyone to visit imdb and rate this move a 10. We need to get it above 7! It's currently sitting at a 6.6 Give this comment thumbs up!!! This movie deserves an 8/10.. I loveddddd it!Ôªø
Peter Gabriel and the film was great!!!Ôªø
Nice movie :) This is biblical movieÔªø
"1.It's not a fact and even if a hundred million people knew what it is, that's still only less then 1/70th of the world's population.
2.The fact that u have heard of smth does not mean you like it.
3.It's not beloved by whatever country, or did u go and ask everyone?
4.Mickey mouse and superman? Get a brain.Ôªø"
"Unless its a 3rd world nation living 100 yrs behind the times... 
The rest of the planet knows who Mickey mouse, Superman, and what starwars is... thats a fact. Google it.

And the original Star wars trilogy is beloved by this entire country.  SO dont and anyone who likes scif movies.  So dont argue for the sake of arguments.
Ôªø"
"1.The whole world? Probably even 1/10th of the world hasn't even heard about them.
2.Out of the people that have seen them, many don't like them either.
3.He has to think the same way as you rofl?Ôªø"
I was surprised  at how much I loved this movie!! I know it got not so great reviews.... I watched it a week ago for the first time and it was exciting most of the time.Ôªø
my personnel opinion of john carter was pretty good. its to bad disney lost so much money with the release it deserved better.Ôªø
this was one of the worst movies i have seen in so long...i don't even really know why i am here to relive the horrorsÔªø

"Is this movie any good? when I first seen trailers it looked like a copy and paste of a few different movies,not very original/  but then read somewhere the original book was written years ago and influenced these copy and pasted movies sooo, i dont know should I give it a look on dvd, or is it tripe>?Ôªø"
"I did not say they are categorically bad, just that they aren't categorically good.  In reality, we're talking about about a dozen movies with Star Trek, and six movies with Star Wars.  Some of them are bad, a handful of them are pretty good.  None of them are what I would call ""good"" sci fi except 2-3 out of the whole bunch.

I'm guessing you're about 11, so I doubt you've seen all of the movies you're hoping to speak for.  I'll just chalk up your behavior to immaturity, and say good day.Ôªø"
IF Star wars & Star trek are bad- then you are not in reality. the entire world  loves both franchises... im not even going to read nay more of your replies. consider anything else you send me DELETED/UNREADÔªø
"Except that the story isn't that good.  If it had been sold as an epic from 100 years ago, and the genius of the writer had been front and center, that would've been one thing... but the movie was built as a modern blockbuster and didn't have the chops for it.  Even the most slack-jawed moviegoer these days knows that you can't breathe on Mars, and the screenplay and acting were just horrible.Ôªø"
@masonTganes does that really matter?  there isnt going to be a second oneÔªø
"Cont'd...

By the way, I'm not hating on SW and ST.  They're just not really ""good"" sci fi most of the time.  For their eras (not counting the vomit-worthy 2nd SW trilogy) they were pretty good, and obviously very entertaining in many cases... just not ""good"" sci fi.Ôªø"
"You mentioned some of the very worst sci fi there, with Star Trek and Star Wars, but I'll let that pass.  You sure don't set your standard very high if those are your best examples.

The problem is, nothing was done to update the science aspect of the movie, and the 100 year old aspect of the story wasn't shown anywhere, it was presented as if it were new.  Had they worked in a 100 year old retro feel, it would've gone over better.  But any child knows you can't breathe on Mars, for example.Ôªø"
"IF this movie is bad-- then both SW trilogies and even the best star trek movies are bad..... because this is in exactly the same vein as those movies.... same type of dialoge..... the problem is that the story is 100 yrs old. Literaly... and tons of  content from this movie has been used for the last hundred yrs in other popular sci fi.
Ôªø"
"and it was one of THE BEST sci fi adventure films of recent years.

john carter:  one of the biggest bombs in cinema historyÔªø
Oh it's rigginsÔªø
When Hollywood makes a new movie its a competition about how much crap they can bring in from all worlds ever thought of.. Ôªø
"This movie is so, so, so, so bad.  The acting, the plot, the dialogue, everything.  The science fiction aspects alone require you to just shut off your brain, and thus it becomes fantasy, and that's just a sign of laziness on the part of the screenwriters.Ôªø"
think    it  was    good  movie  sad      that   the marking  not  goodÔªø
This movie was REALLY good!Ôªø
"comment
Ôªø"
This is like the combination of Science fiction and MythologyÔªø
@Erodawn there isnt going to be a second one.  disney is not going to risk losing another 200 million dollarsÔªø
"I loved this movie. I think that it did so poorly because of marketing. I think I only saw two trailers for this movie before and when it was in theaters. Not only that, but the trailers we not that good. I read the creator wanted the trailer to leave some mystery to the movie, but you have to say SOMETHING about the film. No one I talked to even knew the movie took place on Mars. I only knew because I'm a Burroughs fan. I swear, if they do better on that next time, the film will make a fortune.Ôªø"
This was a fucking great movie!!!!!!!!!!! Surpassed my expectations by farÔªø
"They actually broke even. This film did very well overseas, making up the budget almost entirely on its own. It's only in America that it bombed. I liked this film, (although it was nothing like ""Princess of Mars"" upon which it was based.) and I hope people see it for the good movie it actually is and not for the ""extravagant waste of time"" the critics damned it to be.Ôªø"
"This is the most underrated movie...I really felled in to it i even got the book, im so drawn in to it...I wish/hope they make a sequel, i really do.Ôªø"
"This movie was so cool, and the princess is beatiful. Wish i had one  :(Ôªø"
pretty good flick.  shame its one of the biggest box office bombs in historyÔªø
"Sorry to say it, but the director Andrew Stanton stated that nobody on Disney, except the ones who were involved in John Carter, want a sequel. He's already working on the sequel of one of his previous films, Finding Nemo, and he said that there was no hope to make a Carter sequel until a very long time,even if he's very proud of his movie.

Sadly, whitout money, you can't do a movie, especially a sci-fi one like John Carter. John Carter makers don't care about money, but Disney cares for sure.Ôªø"
Taylor Kitsch undeniable hotness! Damn...Ôªø
"lol, there will never be a sequel. Film making is above all a business even though they are artistic in nature. No company is gonna risk loosing another 200M for the sake of art.Ôªø"
"Awesome movie, pro actors, i liked it very much madafakas!Ôªø"
Movie is AWESOME !!!!Ôªø
inception is 2010 Ôªø
"If it was based on a book by a classic writer (which it was, he even has a cameo in the movie), of course it deserves a movie, PEOPLE.  How many frickin' times can you watch JOURNEY TO THE CTR OF THE EARTH?  There's even one coming out starring ME! JK. But, seriously, classic books should get movies too.Ôªø"
lol disney really fucks shit upÔªø
isohuntÔªø
Worst shitty movie ever yeahÔªø
"they're living rob zombie's dream here.....mars doesn't need women, angry red women anymore because they got them in this movie!!Ôªø"
"dude, come on, how were they going to condense all of the lotr plot in just a single movie? I'm sorry, but i don't see how that's possibleÔªø"
"nah, the best movie of 2012 was inception, but it might've been 2011Ôªø"
"a great movie, only problem is they made the trailer look childishÔªø"
"amazing movie ,  and really good ending . Ôªø"
"I absolutely loved this movie. I don't understand what all the bad press is for. The 'critics,' say it was lame, but everyone I know, (who doesn't work for a publication), including me, loved it...If there was a sequel, I would definitely see the sequel, if they make one.Ôªø"
i like how there is a lot of bloody killing but he cant say ass lolÔªø
Well I hope they reboot it soon then because there are so many great books in this series which could be turned into great movies.Ôªø
Amazing movie! The ending was great.Ôªø
"yh john carter is a little lame for a title, thats probably why they didnt sell as much!Ôªø"
so how did think it was?Ôªø
"The title should be ""Barsoom"" hehe Ôªø"
"Wow, gonna watch it tonight! thanx!Ôªø"
"I just rented this... it was okay I guess. You could tell though that the story was written a LONG time ago.  Back when there were a LOT more mysteries about Mars. There was also something about the way the story ran it's course that also made the story feel old.
Don't get me wrong, stories were written much better way back. However, the story didn't seem to jive with all the up in your face high tech movie graphics. And of course we have long since lost most of that magical mystery of mars.Ôªø"
great movie 6+Ôªø
Actually the contrary. This was one of the msot anticipated movies and everyone was expecting this movie to be the groundbreaking expirience and revolutionary picture. Yet that still did not happend and movie cost more than it actually earned back. Ôªø
"Great movie, and I wonder with them using the author in the storyline as important as they make him are they saying that the story of John Carter is based on FACT? I found it interesting how they wrote this script. Very good movie tho. Really enjoyed it, and just got it on Blu Ray. Hope they make a sequel.Ôªø"
I still do..Ôªø
"i cant beleive it will melt my heart really touching movie.ever seen thank-s to who make this story
Ôªø"
Screw the world! This movie was awesome.Ôªø
i insult all the bastards that make series of movies just to keep collecting money .. there is no point in watching Lord of the rings UNLESS you watch them all .. that's robberyÔªø
don't insult lotr. period.Ôªø
fuck youÔªø
"soo great movies 
Ôªø"
great movie .. u cant wast 9 hours of your life watching a shit movie like the trilogy of lord of the rings .. or u can spend 2 hours watching this good movieÔªø
Same here! But I was so pissed they didnt continue when he came back to marsÔªø
I hated this movieÔªø
"I really think it should have been called A Princess of Mars.
Ôªø"
is this Ben Barnes ???  lolÔªø
spartacus-blood and sand meets star-wars great movie ......Ôªø
Virginia Of Mars :>Ôªø
"This trailer sucked ass, I couldn't get one hit on what the movie was about, a cowboy, a planet, alternate universe, aliens, warriors? Some context in the trailer would be nice. The movie however was reallygoodÔªø"
"I'm currently reading the book that this movie is based on.  ""A Princess of Mars"".  And I've been thinking that this movie could have used a better title such as ""Barsoon"".  Just a notion.Ôªø"
this is the best movie of 2012 hands down i really dont understand why it didnt do good like wtf is wrong with people this days ive seen shitty movies that fucking make more money then this one and they suck and thanks to stupid people that say this movies sucks there is not going to be a john cater two thank you assholesÔªø
"When I say Julius Ceaser and Mark Anthony in this movie I was like ""WUT""Ôªø"
"i actually enjoyed much more this movie than avatar >_>
Ôªø"
Great movie!!  Truth lies in fictionÔªø
Thank you!Ôªø
Peter Gabriel - My Body is a CageÔªø
"What a great movie :) The ending is so unpredictable!! i thought the end is a tragedy but then the twist happened!!! its very good and i recommend this to all of my friends :)

i loved this film! trailer was not the best then i saw the film i was like omg i wish i watched this beforeÔªø
"next sequel is coming in summer, 2015! even though the film was a very loss of money. They said: ""it's about artistic integrity, not money,We want to do this book series justice, no matter the cost. We're happy with the quality of the movie, and we hope to maintain this with the sequels"" 
Now i can't be sure if this news are true or not but hopefully they are true :)

I really want to see a sequel! :DÔªø"
tae lets poopÔªø
This movie was definitely under-rated! And the ending moved me so deeply..Ôªø
I really like the ending...hey jst remembered its TIM RIGGINS #33 lolÔªø
sick film Ôªø
"Finally saw this the other day, it wasn't nearly as bad as the reputation it has received.Ôªø"
Very sad this flopped !!! Only watch this tonight.... A very good movieÔªø
"One of the best movies ever , and the best of 2012 ! Ôªø"

"LOL in the movie at 59:45 when john looks at the girl through the reflection of her sword, she turns around looks at him as he turns away.  then he looks back and flex's his arm lmao.  Its so bad hahahahhaaÔªø"
you are reported to the FBIÔªø
200m net loss.. idk if i should watchÔªø
"This movie is good, but cmon...it's not better than avatarÔªø"
It was based on a book series by Edgar Rice Burroughs.Ôªø
TO THE PIRATEBAY!!!Ôªø
"mparzoum
Ôªø"
I loved evry minuite of this film.it will become a cult classic.the one man battle scene was epic and you could fully understand the rage.a perfect film.Ôªø
Then he screwed himself...... I'm actually talking about the guy that agreed to the budget. Ôªø
"when i saw the trailer i didnt like it.. but i was like what the hell, I watched it and it was the most amazing film i have ever seen.. with a great ending.

avatar is good but it sucks comparing to this.. 

Ôªø"
yea i don't think they aren't going to do a next one... and what do you mean is an original idea of course is not is from a series of books...Ôªø
John Carter is an original idea by Walt Disney himself.Ôªø
"Dude... this trailer's awesome, what're you talking about??? 0.o I loved the movie more than anything too.
Ôªø"
"I just read an article that said that John Carter cost $250 million to make & $100 million to promote so total $350 million. 

I saw this film & theres no way this shitty mistake cost 350 million. Now I've charged personal items on my company card & I've even managed to go my entire life getting others to foot the bill but I would love to meet the guy that convinced Disney to shell out $350 million for this bull shit, b/c even I couldn't keep a straight face while screwing someone that hard. Ôªø"
My body is a cage.Ôªø
horrible trailler epic movieÔªø
"Don't understand the negative critique. It was entertaining and pure escapism.

Btw, the professional critics were split. According to Rottentomatoes about half gave positive reviews and half negative.

A fine cast too.Ôªø"
"WoW what a great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ôªø"
This movie gave me cancer.Ôªø
"This Movie was Absolutly AMAZING!!!!!!!! Better then Avatar, Sadly the Trailer is horrible. But This Movie For Sure is amazing don't let the poorly made trailer fool you, I hoping they make a second one.Ôªø"
"get the dvd, in cinemas was done...Ôªø"
Really want to see this when is it in the cinemas?!?!?Ôªø
john carter reminds me of john marston...Ôªø
disney showed  what is  a proper movieÔªø
This film is not science fiction based on scientific possibilities (such as the stories of HG Wells)  but more pure fantasy - like a cross between the Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. Its not brilliant but it is a decent enjoyable old style adventure epic which the whole family can enjoy...Ôªø
love that!Ôªø
"good movie
Ôªø"
"SI ALGUNA VEZ SE VUELVE A LLEVAR AL CINE A LOS AMOS DEL UNIVERSO, ESTA PELICULA DEBERIA SER EL  CAMINOÔªø"
"The film was meant to be the first of a planned trilogy funded by Disney;of course, those plans are now highly unlikely to go through. Ôªø"
"It was a good movie but the market really fucked it up big time. How is a movie called ""John Carter"" expected to be on mars, people jumping 100 feet in the air and full out fucking warsÔªø"
cool movie i totaly enjoyed every moment of it :)Ôªø
"the film was good, but the ""dog"" was awesomeÔªø"
this reminds me of another movie time machine i thinkÔªø

Not a Top-Movie and also not bad.Have bought the movie on DVD and i like it.Ôªø
that's my reason for watching sci-fiÔªø
i love you John Carter!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
How can he jump so high but walk normally? Why isn't he hopping around like the moon guys did?Ôªø

But very well done. Ôªø"

This movie is EXTREMELY underrated.Ôªø

"This movie is awsome, makes me think back on when Egyptians were once on Mars and traveled back and fourth from earth to osirus .... Nothings new under the sun haha love itÔªø"
I just watched this movie today. It's awesome. It got me at the edge of my seat. There was never a dull moment. Critics are the unhappiest people on earth and beyond. Ôªø
Amazing movieÔªø
this movie was so bad LOL. 4real tho like the nigga could only jump high as fuck like....john carter man. ~~ it wasnt bad... it was horrible as fuck Ôªø
I loved it.  I watched it 10 times in a row and now I'm trying to get everyone else to watch it.  I'm usually the one in my family that picks a holiday movie to watch on Thanksgiving and this my pick for this year.Ôªø

"Just watched the film and i have to say, FUCK THE CRITICS. this is an EPIC movie. Ôªø"
Iam really mad right now this was a excellent movie so why the bad ratings when it first came out.Ôªø
"I've seen it only once in theaters, cause of bad marketing. Damn! Come back!
Ôªø"
OMFG this is the best movie ever..i swear to god..dayum well done.Ôªø
It's like watching a classic sci fi novel right on your screen. Anyone with an imagination will love this movie. It takes you to another world your grandfather or grandmother probably read about in a cheap novel. Just great stuff.Ôªø
bulllshiet movieÔªø
Do ppl ever pay attention how movies do? Disney was sad & upset that this film loss $200 million. Huge azz loss. Ppl need to satrt getting into film studies.Ôªø

"True classic sci-fi when it was written more as fantasy. Not sure why but they claim many hated it. I wanted to see another just like it! It took me out of taxes, politics, and everyday life for a brief moment.Ôªø"
lol same music from ac3 rise trailerÔªø
iiiii loooooooooooove this movie!!!!Ôªø
"This movie and it's financial disaster is just another example how ""modern day professional marketing experts"" manage to ruin a great work.Millions of bucks thrown into the absolutely WRONG marketing campaign, a trailer that makes no sense and the ""shortened"" name of the movie...Because some overpaid genius heard that movies with word MARS were unpopular...Well of course they were unpopular when they were garbage...This one is great and it was supposed to have a full title: ""John Carter of Mars""Ôªø"

man i thought the movie would be a failure! BUT OMG IT WAS AMAZING I SWEAR TO GOD! OH MY GOD!!!Ôªø
"I thought it was a very enjoyable film- don't take it too seriously...It's predictable in some aspects, but considering the story is a 100 years old I found it original and in the same 'class' as war of the worlds, I like this adaptation from the book.Personally the nice-monster-dog was a 'character'that made me laugh a lot:)Ôªø"
amazing? My ass! Learn a new adjective kidsÔªø
"To everyone saying it sucked, y'all should know that the entire star wars trilogy and avatar was taken from this movie adaptation of a 100 year old book. George Lucas and James Cameron said it themselves. Very likely not going to be a JC2 since barely anyone watched it in theaters. Only reason it was considered a flop is because the $70 million revenue didn't exceed the $180 million production cost. It actually ranked fifth in the box office for it's month's release. Pretty good in my opinion.Ôªø"
for those who saw the movie: DOG RULES  :P hahaahÔªø
"Oh, Is that...

Skyrim armor?Ôªø"
You were right the first time .Ôªø
Ah fuck it then.Ôªø
"I'm tempted to watch this again because the first I saw it I thought it was the biggest pile of crap I'd ever had the misfortune to sit through, but after seeing all the good comments I might just see it again to see if I was rightÔªø"
Check your statistics mate; this movie is fucking shit!Ôªø

"Pendragon?  You crazy?  John Carter was written 100 years ago!  goodness, what ignorance.Ôªø"
"It was only considered FLOP because it had a very high budget and the ticket sales did not surpass the expenses.  But I must say, Andrew Stanton did a very excellent job with this movie.  I watched it on theatres with a skeptic approach, but dang I enjoyed it.

I even watched it on dvd for the 3rd time already!  Its that good!Ôªø"
"Is it just me or is it reaally sexy the way she says ""john carter"" ? :DÔªø"

Doest this movie remind you of Chiness movies . 1:14 every1 can fly lol ..Ôªø

"Yeah this movie sucked hard, probably because it was a Disney movie, and we all know that Disney make terrible movies.......Ôªø"
i heard this movie sucked. Avatar was great.Ôªø
Now i call this a cult film! 4.5/5 reason the script doesn't seem to be rightÔªø
"True enough, I was not interested at all to watch it. Even after I got the DVD I didn't have the intention to watch it, but believe me I now regret it. One of the best movies of the year and I don't know why it moderately in box office. Ôªø"
"avatar, star wars, all of them are bad copies of john carter :PÔªø"
Second film? This movie just BARELY made back it's budget and made such a small profit that Disney gave up on the franchiseÔªø
Best movie iv ever watched its just the ending WOW so brilliant i enjoyed every second of the film ! to all that didnt watch it yet trust me WATCH IT!!! Just do it!Ôªø
"hate to tell you but it definitely won't be getting a second film, it was the biggest flop in film history, i've not seen it yet, it probably is good, but it just made such a loss.Ôªø"
"Thought it would be a shit movie , but i was wrong its great , nice one watch it..........Ôªø"

@ArmedWithTime I really want you do get your brain checkedÔªø
@ungas024 Lmao I don't like a long movie? Check out my fucking username you dodo brain. You're seriously as stupid as a 6 year old.Ôªø
Indeed this movie was a fucking beast.Ôªø
"@ungas024 Obviously your nephew and you are dumbass 6 year-olds. This movie was meant to appeal to audiences of all ages only kids like you and your dumb nephew like it. 6 year old kids are idiots who don't understand movies, probably your nephew will smarten up when he grows.Ôªø"
No way...There's no people or alien on Mars! Ôªø
"You have your opinion i have mine, you can stick that sh1t on your butt hole and nobody gives a damn. My 6 year old nephew likes it and i do, i guess your one of those so called film enthusiast who don't like a long movie and fun at the same time. LOL!!Ôªø"
"Just watched it and i enjoyed it, shame they aren't going to make the sequels because now i will never know what happened in the 10 years he was gone... or if there is a happy ending etc! tried googling it but nothing helpful on there! Anyways, good film... Much better than all the other modern sci fi expensive crap we getÔªø"
"LMAO there is no sequel to this flop shit.. Disney raped a classic, nobody wants to see more of this trashÔªø"
"He was just trying to tell you that this forgettable piece of shit John Carter is nowhere even close to the worst of Star Wars.. Honestly even The Phantom Menace is better than this garbage, and The Phantom Menace is a sad pathetic piece of shit.. We all know thatÔªø"
LMAO the movie is a horrible flop nobody is gonna pay to see Disney rape the sequelsÔªø
la vi con mi novia <3 ....Ôªø
"I honestly can't figure out if it has or hasn't.  It cost $250 mil to make and brought in $280the mil. Seems like a profit right? Well Disney originally claimed to have lost $200it mil on the movie. It later came out that number was supposedly an exaggeration, but they still lost money on the movie. I had heard marketing costs where anywhere between $50-100the mil. So who do we believe? Ôªø"
"Disney has said it loat money on the movie. It cost $250 to make and pulles in $280.  Why then would Disney say it still lost money? I heard the marketing costs were $50-100, but no sourece can seem to agree on the exact number. I Ôªø"
my thoughts exactly!!Ôªø
John Carter brought in a profit. It just had a crappy opening week.Ôªø
great movie huh...exciting this movie...Ôªø
"This will definitely be a trilogy, John Carter is a novel written on 1912 and they where 3 original novels for that and followed by quite alot. i wanna see the other 2. thumbs up so the producers will make those other 2. :)Ôªø"
This film is an absolute piece of crap. The original books are really interesting and full of action. And what we have here. A flying city? A transporting medallion? Bullshit. The screenwriter should have had a brain cancer for such a distortion of an original classic books. I hope there won't be a sequel and there will be a normal remake with normal script and actors.Ôªø
remake from FLASH GORDON ?Ôªø
"John Carter cost a ton of money to make and made very little and if you believe their marketing costs, it actually coat Disney money. It's this generation's Waterworld. Now I happened to like it, bit use common sense. It was a financial failire and that's all companies care about.Ôªø"
"Don't hold your breath. I liked it too, but it isn't likely ot get a sequel. Ôªø"
"I was surprised how much I liked it. It was a fun sci fi/fantasy, epic, adventure. Liked it more than I thought I would. Ôªø"
Based on a true story? hmmm...Ôªø
I loved this movie.Ôªø
"You don't get it, this guy's a retard.. John Carter is the worst movie of 2012Ôªø"
ok yeah its a good movie but nowhere as near as good as the original Star Wars. nuff said.Ôªø
@chuck van wyk Good? This movie is absolute shite. It is rightfully the flop it deserves to be.Ôªø

"the worst Frickin' movie i have ever seen in my whole life the trailer makes it look like an awesome peice of crap but i barely made it through the whole thing :p

Ôªø"
this movie was worth going to the cinema Ôªø
this was the best movie ever!!!! Ôªø
"Ojala vengas mas, una II, III,..excelente
Ôªø"
Me gusto mucho.Ôªø
Where is it? Ôªø
why the fuck are all new jaybob releases such garbage quality... and why is everyone still giving them a a10/v10 rating to all them lolÔªø
U know actually Avatar got the idea from the John Carter book.Ôªø
It's actually based on a book written in the early years of the 20th century. /factwatchÔªø
its ok Ôªø
"a little history for those of you who are new. This movie is based on the first novel of a book series, John Carter of Mars, written in 1912. 1912 was a time when scientists believed that there was possibility that life was on mars. This theory grew when Percival Lowell gazed at the planet and noticed canals that seemed man made(the famous mars face also helped infatuate the idea). It didn't help that Mars is Similar to earth. And all that led to this book. Tis an Old book, but far from stupid.Ôªø"
The absolute best of this genre that I've seen in years. The original book was written 100 years ago.Ôªø
Is this film any good? Didn't do to well with critics! Big budget tooÔªø
woola . the fastest dog everÔªø
 still a better lovestory then Twilight :PÔªø
Must WatchÔªø
"I guess it is because its not named like ""thor"" or ""hulk"" or ""SWAG"" that it is not getting the attention it deserves. Or the budget was short for enough advertising and marketing.
Great movie!Ôªø"
Very fantastic movie you all have to watch this one :O Ôªø
so close :DÔªø
very good movie ! Ôªø
Underrated MovieÔªø
fuck u Ôªø
unfortunately they spent like 200million over budget and they made a huge loss but i loved the film :)Ôªø
no shit we are on the internet you can get just about anything for freeÔªø
I want to go to mars to jump !! xDÔªø
based on true story Ôªø
Except Prince of Persia is waaay better.Ôªø
One of the best movies of 2012Ôªø
Avatar maybe ! :DÔªø
One of the most amazing movies in 2012  ! I really loved the movie ! (Y)Ôªø
"helll yea very true friend i saw this movie and was just amazing its diffrent from scifi films thats what makes it grate and the fact its from a story 100 years in the making with out edger rice burroughs i doubt we have star wars or movie grates like that to this day 
Ôªø"
one of the best ive ever seen..Ôªø
"did you know ""john carter"" existed for 100 years now, its base on a series of novels Edgar rice burroughs wrote, btw, the guy that read the book in the movie  is Mr. burroughs :P this is simply fantastic, its the past of science fiction, its what gave us things like avatar, star trek and other movies / games :D im a fan of burroughs :)Ôªø"
You got me ;)Ôªø
"you guys who have not seen the movie! 
WATCH IT!
It's maybe the best movie ever made so far! actors + the history, it's so damn great! 
The end of the movie just bleeeeeeeeew me away!
Wow. Im speachless! hahaÔªø"
utter shite!Ôªø
And top 10 Movies in another tabÔªø
the trailer looks shitÔªø
It'sSherlock Holmes + Avatar + Prince of Persia + Star Wars all in one :pÔªø
well tht looks crapÔªø
1:13 WTF ?Ôªø
EPIC MOVIE IS... EPIC!!!! JUST WATCH GOOD S***Ôªø
"Oh puhlease. Companies show their logos but NOT on the film title. Take a look at the clip again, @ 1:36 it reads: Disney John Carter.   You might think that's awsome but I like to choose my movies on their own merits, not based on which conglomorate bank rolled them. In fact, please show me some other companies that slap their brand on the actual film title 'cause I can't find any.Ôªø"
"Does the dogs in this movie have a particular name, because I realy want one of these !Ôªø"
Hmm the name sounds better..Ôªø
What exactly is the point of pasting the Disney logo on the film title? Does Mickey Mouse make a cameo? Will there be a John Carter ride at Disneyland? Will there be an officially licensed JC dolly I can collect?Ôªø
this is like avatar :\ Ôªø
"awesome movie, i was a bit skeptical specially after reviewing some random comments...
But i can safely say this is worth watching, I'd even say it's worthy of place on the shelf...

Ôªø"
"he grew up on earth, which has a heavier gravity than mars.Ôªø"
it looks like a great movieÔªø
He is the Fullback from Friday Night Lights Ôªø
Good movie with a lot of adventure and a few laughs. I always love movies where we get to explore another planet. the ending was great and there are enough possibilities for a sequel. I'd recommand itÔªø
thumbs up if you use thepiratebayÔªø
"Really loved the movie
Ôªø"
Amen. Ôªø
"he's super sexy. <3 
Ôªø"
Thumbs if you have it on DvD from thilandÔªø
FILM OBLEDNIE DOBRY . GORACO POLECAM.Ôªø
"I dont know why people downed this movie. I thought it was a great story line, plot, and execution. Well done DisneyÔªø"
They need to design a ride in Disneyland/world..Ôªø
Best Movie!Ôªø
Here because I find Taylor Kitsch wildly attractive.Ôªø

"that movie was surprisingly good, but i think it fail because we have seen alot of these stuff.. nothing newÔªø"
what is the name of the songÔªø
one of the best movie ive ever watched.dont listen to critics.Ôªø
"Mars has 2 moons, Ôªø"
"it's kinda weird that moon and earth appear so close from mars , since we almost don't see mars as a dot. and they see earth and moon like we see moon :P but hell it's awesome movie , THAT FUCKING DOG IS THE GREATEST EVER :D i almost cried when he went alone into battle with him , amazing movie.Ôªø"
"very good movie.best adventure movie in this year
Ôªø"
explain...? Let me know! Everyone else Keep the comments rolling. I'm truly hopeful that Dvd sales alone may revive this franchise even if it is not with Disney. Ôªø
"saw it yesterday, it was better than I expected... however humans evolved on Mars??  I am just saying don't take to much science into account if you watch this movie :-) and the princess is the sexiest alien I ever saw ;-)Ôªø"
thumbs up if you have torrent open in another tabÔªø
"I just watched the video.  After all of the bad press by the critics, I didn't expect it to be very good.  I was amazed at what an excellent movie it is!  Disney ought to re-release it and promote it this time.Ôªø"
JESUS I HAVE JUST WATCHED THIS  MOVIE!! TOTALLY AMAZING! THE TRAILER SHOWS NOTHING! THE MOVIE IS BETTER THAN AVATAR!! IT IS A MUST SEE!Ôªø
its peter gabriel my body is a cage its quite a long song i think about 5-6 minutesÔªø
Finally saw it on DVD tonight...and I'm rather sad that I didn't go see it on a big screen.Ôªø
"When i read the comments in this video i feel like people are trying to make me watch the movie on free video-stream sites, rather than buy it... wtf??? Not like i was gonna buy it but still... there are people that would buy it, and support the artist, so dont try to shove that free video-stream up everyones ass, keep it to your fu**ing self, besides if people want to watch it for free they certantly allready know how to, or are just plain... ""slow""Ôªø"
i thought this movie was good. I'll buy it.Ôªø
It's average.Ôªø
"is it really that bad a movie - the trailer looks good - will get it on dvd for sure - 
Ôªø"
"Virginia, virginia, virginia.. it was so funny..Ôªø"
waaay BETTER THAN THE HUNGER GAMES...they came out the same timeÔªø
what the hell!!!Ôªø
"You just named an archetypal template. How can ANYONE steal that? But I agree, Avatar was not that good. Just Pocahontas with blue people and a much better visual feast. Ôªø"
"A masterpiece? Not even remotely close. I agree that the marketing for this movie was textbook ""what not to do,"" but there was still a reason that it got poor reviews from critics and fans alike. It's not horrible, but it's very average. The source material itself isn't even that good, which could be part of the reason. The other is that it just seems very derivative nowadays. Like others said, it feels like a mix of movies we've already seen.Ôªø"
"I love GoT! But what are you talking about? Apparently Martin, rather than writing the next book, is working on a prequel. Could be interesting...or not...Ôªø"
"a ball of light that spreads ?

GTFO

This film is easily superior to Avatar, because Avatar stole the idea of a man from another place, being taken out of that place, and put in another, in the middle of a war which he eventually leads and fights in.

So fuck off. Ôªø"
0:44 avatar?!?!?Ôªø
'This movie is dedicated to Steve Jobs'... the only intresting thing  I see in this movie.Ôªø
he's using dovahkiin's armor!Ôªø
now i wanna watch some brunette porn vids.Ôªø
Awesome trailer. Can't say the same for the film.Ôªø
Texas forever!Ôªø
john carter jump good xDÔªø
What a storyy :(Ôªø
thanksÔªø
"I wanna see this now. I'll be honest, if the title had said ""of mars"" I might have actually watched the trailer and gotten interested. I mean... I'm a sci fi fan... and maybe it's sad that I don't know the name ""john carter"" from sci fi, but fact is I don't... they should have gone with the original title... John Carter of Mars. I think they'd have made their projectionsÔªø"
bahahaÔªø
"i watched dat Movie Amazing! 
VIRGINIA :! Ôªø"
Wait what. That's Gambit and Silver fox...she can't be his love interest...ew.Ôªø
Hey it's Gambit! I love him...but I still don't want to watch this...Ôªø
"honestly i can't agree with you more then i already do, i've already convinced over 50 of my friends to go and watch it at the movies, and they all have enjoyed it... since not enough people got to see it, i am marketing it myself, just because i believe it deserves more audience. i want john carter 2... :D Ôªø"
Great film!!Ôªø
im about 2 watch this movie now...and i never even heard of it.. maybe they should of put a portion of those monies on promotion llsÔªø
dude this fucking movie was goddam horrible i nearly fell asleepÔªø
Great movie!Ôªø
"virginia

lolÔªø"
I just watched the movie and i Highly recomande this movie !Ôªø
"I just watched like half of ""John Carter"" online and had to just turn it off. The movie is so so so agonizingly bad i just couldn't sit through another hour of it. I couldn't understand half of what was going on. It was tacky as hell. Absolutely horrid. i give it an A+ for graphics but an F for absolutely everything. I can see how a 4 or 5 year old would be remotely interested but damn. I feel sorry for those who wasted their money to go see it in theaters. Disney really fell off on this oneÔªø"
Looks awsome. I dont wanna compare anything cus no movie deserves that but dont ya'll think its kind of avatar mixed with starwars and bugs?Ôªø
"is it he who has the orginal or is it Arcade Fire?
Ôªø"
"Lucas! I'm absolutely agree with you here! This movie is just brilliant... In the time, when Avengers recieve 100% positive reviews and earn 1 000 000 000 $, John Carter is a sip of the great old-school adventure.. To my mind it's a masterpiece.. Excellent Script, great visual effects and magnificent score... I love this movie so much!Ôªø"
YES RIGGINSÔªø
"this movie was sick awsome great funny and,- i never use this word because it's usually an insult in the movies because its used as a description for when there is a lack of real stuff to describe because of how bad the movie was but im being serious here- it was 'FUN'! i would enjoy an entire princess of mars series like this! it would own starwars for sure. too bad it tanked... =(Ôªø"
lmaoÔªø
Muyy Buena!!! *.*Ôªø
Gambit and Wolverine's wife...i think he's gonna be mad!Ôªø
"Och Ohem, Ochtey, Wheis... Barsoom!Ôªø"
"I actually liked and understood the film. Haha, maybe it was the romance and action that made me pay attention more xDÔªø"
"Peter Gabriel - My Body Is A Cage 
Ôªø"
watch the movie and you'll know. Ôªø
"Terribly directed, No connection with the characters, Awful story progression, dunno WHAT'S really going on, lol shame! had real potential, maybe better after 3 or 4 views lol think thats y it bombed.Ôªø"
"The story of John Carter came out way before Prince of Persia and Avatar, in fact they probably stole ideas from it...douche Ôªø"
VORGINIA!Ôªø
Haters gonna hate.. and who's the retarded? We're talking about the MOVIE.Ôªø
The video told me to comment and I dont want to make the video mad. Ôªø
Are you retarded? John Carter came out waaaay before Avatar or Prince of Persia...Ôªø
i read some news that it was a big FLOP... but when watch it last night well its not bad at all.. =)Ôªø
i love the piano piece. anyone know what its called?Ôªø
"The movie is actually good I watched it lasnight, the trailer made me think it would be a stink movie but it wasnt.Ôªø"
just finished watching the movie this is what I have to say....I love it!!! is agreat movie to bad it didn't made the projected profits this kill any chance for a sequel. oh well I'll read the books anyway. Ôªø
"Wrong.  Do some research, kid!Ôªø"
"Well, did you see it?Ôªø"
"You know what the fuck is stupid about John Carter? He is a fucking adventurer, but doesn't know how to use sign language to communicate if you can't understand someone.Ôªø"
it's a good movie but i feel sorry for them not making any profit. good movie though. Just got done watching like 3min ago.Ôªø
"It was an excellent transfer from book to movie the only true reason it failed was more or less due to poor marketing. Having cost $350 mill to produce, it's loss was projected to be a little over $80 million. Now we all know the what is going on in the world today and when I watch a movie and I think little of my life or the things going on I feel ""transported."" If anyone else knows what I'm talking about then you also know that this movie deserves much more respect.Ôªø"
"THIS MOVIE ROCKZZ!!!!!
i just finished watching it..ohh yeahhh..Ôªø"
VIRGINIA!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
"$84 million loss? That is definitely...

(puts on sunglasses)

AN EPIC FAIL.

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!Ôªø"
"The more I see it, the more I love it!!! 
haters gonna hate anyway
Hope they will make the second one!
Ôªø"

"Just saw the DVD... yep, it sucks.Ôªø"
"I just watched this movie for the second time in 1 day... This movie simlpy ROCKS!!!

"I always thought it was like the Fern Gully in space.
Ôªø"
Why the fuck am I only seeing this now??!!Ôªø
why the fuck am I only seeing this now?Ôªø
The Ventriloquist starring Kevin Spacey was much better than the John Carter trailer HAHA!!!!Ôªø
Avatar was just Dance With Wolves in space. I'm just wondering how many people here know that this movie is based on a book from 1917.Ôªø
jaybob it izzz Ôªø
Movie is freakin awesome! Bought it on bluray idk how this movie flopped in theater's?Ôªø
@fsfsto YES. It is worth watching.Ôªø
Best movie I've ever seen since AVATAR. Who knew a hot princess would be threatening? I give it a 15/10 if it was possible.Ôªø
i just loved this movie it was the best storyÔªø
"This movie is AWESOME.
It has everything, tonnes of action, sci-fi and a smoking hot princess.
It just definitively shows that the newspapers/IMDB/other movie rating places have no fucking idea what they're talking about.
9.7/10. Ôªø"
"If you like sci-fi, yes.
I just finished watching it, and I absolutely loved it. Action, sci-fi, touch of romance with a hot girl (true love and all that crap) = perfect.Ôªø"
"Awesome movie. Ignore what the newspapers say, just go watch itÔªø"
It was awesomeÔªø
one word. atlantisÔªø
"isohuntDOTcom-torrents-?ihq=jaybob
You can trust jaybob.
the - represents a forward slashÔªø"
"well , is it worth watching ?Ôªø"
"This movie looks relly good the first 30 minutes but after that it's just bullshit, true bullshit. not worth the download tbh.Ôªø"
looks like another Air bender...Ôªø
"thanks in advance,,,Ôªø"
"what site  did you visit to  download the john carter movie ??.. Because, I've that most movie downloading sites are dangerous to visit (viruses, spyware etc etc)Ôªø"
Would you please sign it???... Ôªø
"I am starting an online petition to try an convince DISNEY CORP. to shoot JOHN CARTER 2.
I am trying to get a BUTTLOAD of people signing it and promising to WATCH the sequel. Well, if it gets made... WE WANT TO SEE JOHN CARTER 2 WALT DISNEY CORP,,Ôªø"
"this movie was great, detach from genre and just enjoy the visual/artistic aspect, being put into a different world, the characters and the story line.Ôªø"
dont do it. it was HORRIBLE!Ôªø
"This looks great, its like a futuristic 1800's cowboy movie, i'm downloading right now.Ôªø"
Why do I have to watch an ad before watching a trailer...?Ôªø
this movie sucks!Ôªø
the fuck? what's this movie's genre? Ôªø
"John Carter: Ak Ohum Oktay Weez...
 
-my name is in that chant ^^
Ôªø"
didnt this movie bankrupt disney or somethingÔªø
"Ok you two put them away, it's just a movie trailer you really going to fight like kids online?Ôªø"
"If I said that Pocahontas did it before Avatar than I obviously didn't say Avatar did it first. And you clearly don't understand what ""looks like"" means; I never said the movie is a carbon copy of the movie Avatar, just that it *looks* like it. I'm not going to watch a movie that looks exactly like a shitty movie. Get over it.Ôªø"
"Weird cause I belive you said, Quoting you, ""Sure sounds like Avatar which was basically Pocahontas in space"" Which in my book is you're saying Avatar did it so this movie must be coping avatar, giving way to my previous post on you thinking that Avatar has done it first. In all real honesty, you had no argument to say that his movie looks like Avatar, because to my knowledge you have yet to watch said movie.Ôªø"
I didn't say that at all. I didn't say anything you just said I was saying. Ôªø
It's actually a pretty decent movie and better than most of the crap that came out this yearÔªø
"Lol, Are you saying that Avatar did it first? And sorry but you might enjoy the movie if you watched it, I know it's scary to do new things. Judge something by it genre is stupid sir. Get your head out your ass, noone is making you watch the movie but don't judge it by what you've seen before, that like reading a Sherlock Holmes Novel and saying I won't read Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys cause it's the same genre.Ôªø"
"It's a movie about a man who goes to an alien planet, becomes a great warrior, and the savior of a native tribal people. Sure sounds like Avatar, which was basically Pocahontas in space. Get your head out of your ass.Ôªø"
"Avatar is the most overrated movie i know, everything was bad or unoriginal, only thing that was good was the environment..Ôªø"
"Looks nothing like Avatar, only thing this has that Avatar has was a planet other then earth. Don't judge a book by its cover.Ôªø"
Looks too much like Avatar. Not interested.Ôªø
way Better dudeÔªø
"the movies good! dont understand why people hating! get a life!
Ôªø"
i watched the trailer & still watched the movie. i don't think it was the trailer that killed it but the plot. it was all good and fine except the fact it was happening on mars - hated that!Ôªø
"watching trailers just to make sure it is worth the download,,


 jaybob anyone????????Ôªø"
"For those of you wondering, the song is a remix of ""My Body is a Cage"" by Arcade FireÔªø"

"One of the best films I've ever seen!! Other movies are just like a ""meh"" nothing much but Cabin in the woods and this one to me are the best! I didn't really like the Avengers much because I knew what was gonna happen... You don't have to watch the whole movie to know the ending but I still watched it and it was fun but meh.Ôªø"

"LOL a human goes to an unknown land where he has special powers and he is the one to save them,kind of looks like an opposite superman plot here:PÔªø"
I really don't know why this movie flopped. It was so much better than that garbage Clash of the Titans 2010 and Cowboys and Aliens yet those movies made more money. Ôªø
Awesome Movie.... Very Cool....Ôªø
I thought it was a pretty good movie.Ôªø

I'm a huge movie buff and hate wasting my time in boring second rate films but should tell those who are pondering watching it its worth it. From beginning till end interesting. And no, i havent read the booksÔªø"

"And It doesnt matter if ppl like or dislike fantasy if noone shows support to rhe movie by watching it, then  it doesnt matter if is good or nadÔªø"
If im not mistaken the ceo of walt disney had toresigned coz of how poorly this movie made. When it came to profits I believe they mention that walt lost 200 mill and only made 70 mill in revenueÔªø
"Well, you might not like fantasy movies or even adventure movies with a lot of CGI in them. But this movie still beat a lot of big budget Hollywood movies when it comes to story and excitment.Ôªø"
"Well, it seems you don't watch a lot of movies. Ever seen any of the Transformer movies? Those are the worst ever.Ôªø"
"Overall it's a very good popcorn movie, but this trailer doesn't show that at all. Most characters are changed a bit from the book and parts of the story has been changed. But still it gives me the same feeling of Mars as the Burroughs books do.Ôªø"
this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my lifeÔªø
This movie was so bad I feel like they owe me money for watching itÔªø
I f****** love this movie!Ôªø
such a bad movieÔªø
"Love the trailer but have seen the full movie twice at the theatre and in 3D and it does justice to Edgar Rice Burroughs series of novels regarding his mythical Barsoom (Mars).  If you really want to enjoy the movie, read one or more of his Barsoomian novels; e.g., ""Warlord of Mars"", ""Chessmen of Mars"", ""Thuvia, A Maid of Mars"", etc., ...

I watched it today. Awesome movieÔªø
I think back in the olden days of sci-fi novels they cared more about the over all adventure  and fantasy of the story rather then the how and why.Ôªø

this movie had me falling asleep at the theaters! just straight garbage! the ending was kind of exciting & woke me up a little.Ôªø
"oh right... i forgot that... in fact, at that time we were only starting to develop aircraft technology.... which is why in the movie, flying in the air is such a big thing......
nice movie though, just that not many realise that it was written way early than most science fiction that we have now.... Ôªø"

it was a good movie.. its sad they labeled it as an epic failure. now i might not be able to see the sequelÔªø
PETER GABRIEL! ExcitingÔªø
"They got lower income cuz their title really sucks, I don't know why and what purpose did they make that title for this movie, it really sucks i think. Ôªø"
he is so hot!!!Ôªø
"Movie was okay, but the title really sucks in my view. You cant really tell what kind of movie it is from it and it just gives people the incentive to think; ""Huh, I think I will watch something else instead...""Ôªø"

"this actually looks pretty good... i havent watched it yet, but i dont really see much flop material based on the trailer... i guess the studio just placed to much faith in the title and pumped up the budget a bit too high.Ôªø"

to much back story is what i heard and tv or movie audiences really don't have the attention span for i blame it on the technology if something does not grab your attention in two seconds were clicking with a mouse to something elseÔªø
"the actor from friday night lights tv series heads this, i will reserve opinion on the movie as i have not seen it. I think it would be better if Taylor would of started in small roles in  movies build up a profile and grow it's hard to jump from the small to big screen imediately anyway.  i think he is canadian, so  as i am myself i would like to see this film do well but every time its a dice throw and actors are not going to pass up work .
Ôªø"
The film was faptasticÔªø
but this trailer is giving the wrong ideas.Ôªø
This film was great btw.Ôªø
let them come...Ôªø

better in 3DÔªø
"Made my first IMovie video trailer check it out, Comment and leave a like, 
ThanksÔªø"
"maybe because noboy knew there is a book called John carter From mars since 2 month?^^

i think till next friday it will gross the 250 million production costs, beacuse it isn't released in japan yet, and i'm sure the japanese wil freakin love this movie, so maybe we get a second part.
they should let us donate some money for a second part, they would swim in money.Ôªø"
One of the few times that the movie was better than the book.Ôªø
"This movie was well worth it. I loved it, it was fun, and the special effects are incredible. I honestly don't know how it is not doing better. People need to go support this movie and watch it. I think it has a chance of being a success after bluray 3D sales. It is one of those movies I will buy for sure.Ôªø"
"Still don't get how he breathes or how he doesn't freeze in a matter of seconds being on Mars. Then again, if they don't explain how or why there are Martians exactly like humans, I guess they don't care about the small stuff. Imagination and movies I suppose. Good flick though. Don't know how it bombed so bad. Shoulda had a race of just hot girls. Would sell out everywhere.Ôªø"
Its obviously a remake of Avatar but with Mickey and Minnie.Ôªø
"its a great movie, even if there won't be second part!!!
@geeking yes, i start reading the books now, and i would be very happy if there would be an uncut version, even though i think that the scene were Tal gets decapitatet is wrong in an pg-13 movie. all the blue blood :D

and who noticed the similarity with halo?Ôªø"
i watched the movie and which is goodÔªø
Is that He-Man?Ôªø
"wow! how did they get all the actors and the equipment to Mars?

@supergraham89 How much Disney paid you for this ? Sorry  but you need to do more in order to reduce the 200 M $ loss this horseshit gave Disney. Ôªø
"Just read in the paper this movies become the biggest flop for years, the budget they had to make it, and it hasnt delivered at the box office, regardless of what people may think its really good. Trouble is its got all the action, sfx looks typically stunning, and thats wot we're all used to, but it also just looks like a forgettable fantasy blockbuster movie. One u wud just take ur kids to see on weekends thats all. Ôªø"

"" John Carter"" is one of history's biggest flops.""<<<<=== HAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA @ Disney Corporation..Ôªø"
"Great movie. Poor ROI. I blame everyone behind the making of every trailer for this film. They over-sold the movie making the film look tired. Poor job. It's almost as if someone didn't want it to succeed. Or, Disney is clearly losing its flavor. Or, both. Imagine? Hmmm.Ôªø"

"@Wolfen443 ...if it were not for the PG-13 rating, the Barsoomians would have been dressed correctly....no clothing, only jewelry and belts to carry weapons and other items. Considering the original writings were written in the early 1900's rather daring of Burroughs, eh?Ôªø"

"At least Disney did not screw up the characters, other than that it was an OK FAMILY FRIENDLY VERSION of the hard core original novel. I would love to see the Original Novel being done by Cable or a more rirsk taking studio later on  in time. A Restricted film version of the novel could be nice too. It had decent action, a respectable storyline, and the weird Star Wars & Avatar connection did not turned me off the film. The princess should have worn a sexier outfit, that was the only complain. Ôªø"
@tapalodo1 it's more than that....it's super nice..worth your money and time :))Ôªø

"@goddesmissyify ...Very likely no one spoke of that DVD version just as most regard Dune (David Lynch version) is a pale reflection of the original novel. Saw that version on Sci-Fi Channel. Not bad but also a pale reflection. Yes, many of the same Burroughs' concepts but set in modern times (Carter served in Afghanistan?) and the Tharks in this straight-to-DVD version only had 2 arms???!!Ôªø"

Come on Look at him. He is a fuckin model. A pretty face. Doesn't look like a warrior what so ever! He could fit perfectly to the bold and the  beautiful series.

john carter is gambit and that is wolverine's girl that means??? lmaoÔªø
@naumutroi im actually lookin forward to john carter of mars nowÔªø
"@loza2101 Yes? Prince of Persia, Avatar, Dune and Star Wars are from 1912? lolÔªø"
"@Can0fpepsi Also, the chichen and the egg paradox is also a vague reference to the finale of Star Trek the Next Generation. The plot device in this episode would work well in John Carter of Mars.Ôªø"
"@SpidermanVsVenom1 yup. I hope they do it with reverence to its original source materiel much the same way the Lord of the Rings trilogy did to Prof. Tolkien's stories. I understand that for various reasons you cannot reproduce the novel page for page but i will be satisfied if 75% to 90% of the film is taken from ""Princess of Mars"".Ôªø"
" This movie is genuinely a million times better than this trailer leads you to think. Folks, trust me, go see it. Toy Story writer and director making a scifi fantasy? No brainer. Go see it...Ôªø"
@beavoru2 YesÔªø
@loza2101 NoÔªø
Prince of Persia + Avatar + Dune `+ Star Wars Episode 1 = John CarterÔªø
@naumutroi Nice Comment! I'm a huge fan of this gendre of story. Will be interesting to see how the inspired will treat the inspiration...Ôªø
"this looks like shit
Ôªø"
i havent even heard of the book and i want to see this....i feel differentÔªø
Every single one of these comments is TL;DRÔªø
"@naumutroi ....very likely astral travel will be in the movie, if it were changed there would be many upset Burroughs' fans. How different the movie will be from the original we'll find out soon. There is already one change..the Barsoomians wear clothes.,.lol.,.necessary, of course, if they want to keep the PG-13 rating. Also Spiritualism was quite fashionable in upper Society between the 1840s-1920s so it's no wonder astral travel was included. A novel that does reflect it's timesÔªø"
"@naumutroi ..oh, I've no issues about similar imagery. Similar  imagery is unavoidable. Human experience is such that only familiar images must be offered otherwise the audience can not relate and enjoy the story being told. Which is why there are sounds of star drives and sounds of explosions in space. I don't dwell on the images presented, I prefer to judge a movie on the enjoyment I have, not whether a visual image is ""ripped-off"" from a previous successful movie.Ôªø"
"@naumutroi aye, i may have over stated when saying movie directors ""rip off"" ideas from other films/shows.
though my original statement went somthing like this "" rip off of several other movies iv seen "" when i guess i should stated ""similarities""
lawl@chicken and egg paradoxÔªø"
@geekeing The one thing i do hope they change in this adaptation from the original is the astral travel - time travel thing in the cave. That never really worked for me as a plot device. Ôªø
"@Can0fpepsi Lucas and his partners such as john dykstra created visuals that are unlike the original tv show since the 1966 show lacked the techknolegy. if anything lucas and his team borrowed ideas for visuals from 2001 a Space Odyssey and then went light years beyond them. For the other four Star Trek shows and most of the movies, Paramount asked George Lucas the Galactic Emperor to have his  company, ILM create the visuals and effects and thus the simularities. Ôªø"
"@geekeing both lucas and roddenberry were influenced by many of the same things as writers. now days there is very little if anything that is 100% original. And even though John Carter of Mars predates nearly every sci-fi franchise by nearly a hundred years. Screen-writers, Art Directors and Visual Effects and the like are people who were raised on Avatar, Stargate, Star Trek, Star Wars and the like and creates a chichen and the egg paradox.Ôªø"
"@geekeing indeed,it was a good discussion. farewellÔªø"
@naumutroi ...a excellent defense of Lucas and Star Wars. But I never said Star Wars was a rip-off of Star Trek. I'm a fan of both. Rather I was asking someone else if he thought so based on visual images alone. He determined this movie is a rip-off of others by the images presented without any regard for the plot. That person and I have reached an understanding. If you review our entire comment exchange you will see what it was we discussed.Ôªø
"@Can0fpepsi ...ah, you are constant in your assessment and I respect you for that. And I thank you for your defense regarding naumutroi's comment. It seems he didn't see all our comments, eh?...lol. You are right about the visual images (plot devices) being similar in so many movies whatever the genre. There are just so many images within human experience that many are used over and over again. Hopefully storylines will differ....my respects, I wish you Success in all you undertakeÔªø"
LED ZEPPELIN KASHMIR is the song's name Ôªø
"@naumutroi i also stated i wouldn't watch this movie,though i am reconsidering after seeing the trailer 20timesÔªø"
"@naumutroi im the one who said star wars is a rip off of star trek. but not stoy line.
but more so in digital effects.basically if it wasn't for old shows like Star trek,we wouldn't have movie's like star wars.. the old school paved the way
(what i was actually saying though is that this trailer aka movie is a rip off of several other movies) then geekeing wanted to let me know this trailer is nothing like any other movies, story line wise anyways.Ôªø"
"Gambit & Kayla! I knew it. Wolverine, sorry bro.Ôªø"
"@geekeing to say Star Wars is a rip off of star trek is rather funny and absurd. Lucas's influences is so much deeper than that. Star Wars is Lucas's compasite of everything he saw at the movies and or read - in particular the classics and the woprks of Prof. Joseph Campbell. Everything from Flash Gordan, Buck Rodgers to WW2 movies to westerns to samurai films, to  Greek-Roman mythology Star Wars was inspired by and influenced by and not simply Star Trek.Ôªø"
"@balamb25 hard to convince people who did not read the classic Edgar Rice burroughs novels. Burroughs, Wells, Howard, Tolkien, Verne, Stevenson, Lovecraft, Homer and many others that these people who watch tv too much and dont bother to pick up a book and read do not know about that inspired and created so much. Avatar and Prince of Persia rehash stories written by these giants.Ôªø"
"I watched commercial of this movie before actual video, nice job youtube!Ôªø"
@geekeing indeed it isÔªø
@misigonysticostrich Yes off course. It¬¥s an Edgar Rice Burroughs masterpiece. Tarzan¬¥s Creator.Ôªø
"@Can0fpepsi ...OK...but I wonder, by your own criterion, then ....spaceships...green aliens....Star Wars is a rip-off of Star Trek, the TV series?Ôªø"
The girl in this movie is the same girl from 'x-men origins'Ôªø
this look like a PRINCE PERSIA Ôªø
@balamb25 it's not the original -- it's a shitty adaptation by a shitty company. the novel is the original -- this is dung.Ôªø
"@geekeing youll never change my opinon about this movie copying other movies.
an its not like i said the book was copying other movies.. 
theres so many different interpretations for my words. especially when i say this movie is copying others.. .an you seem to have miss interpret what iv said..
i dont mean the storylines of the movie has been done befor, though i do mean iv seen this type of movie a dozen times.Ôªø"
"@geekeing well, The Barsoom series may literary be the forefather for many sci-fi movies, but those sci-fi movies are now the forfather for this sci-fi book.. because without those movies, Barsoom ,man from mars w/e the fuck it is, would still be a book,
an when this book,leaves paper its copying EVERY fucking movie befor it...Ôªø"
"@Can0fpepsi ....you're starting to get it, but you still miss the mark of the quote. When Cameron made reference to the Edgar Rice Burroughs he was referring to the novels. There have been no movies based on the Barsoom series before (although efforts have been made since 1931). And I quoted Cameron to show the influence Burroughs had on modern sci-fi including Star Wars. The Barsoom series is truly the literary forefather of many sci-fi movies and stories.Ôªø"
Looks like a combination of Prine of Persia and AvatarÔªø
"@geekeing common sense says james cameron will refer to other movies he's seen an done in the past  5-10 years, *cough* ripoff*cough*
and  didn't say avatar. i said starwars..
now i didn't realize John Carter is from Mars.. that actually makes it a little more interesting,but not by much.. 
and i also didn't know james cameron was doing the film, that also peeks my intrestÔªø"
Wow ...this first trailer sucks... the second one is waaaay more appealingÔªø
"kya avatar..gabung ama the immortal,,i think :)Ôªø"
"@SnooblerRubbleBoots ....doubtful....Tatooine doesn't have a planetary canal system, in fact, neither does Dune.Ôªø"
"@Can0fpepsi ...lol.....you got it so wrong! Yes, until you look past your superficial prejudgements there can be no further discussion. Let me give you something to ponder (if you able to)...a quote from James Cameron from a 2009 interview with ""The New Yorker"": ‚ÄúWith ‚ÄòAvatar,‚Äô I thought, Forget all these chick flicks and do a classic guys‚Äô adventure movie, something in the Edgar Rice Burroughs mold, like John Carter of Mars‚Äîa soldier goes to Mars,‚Äù 
Ôªø"
"@geekeing dude, any movie produced in today's society is a rip off of another movie. this is just common sense. if u cannot see this than i am done with ""your"" closed mind.Ôªø"
Glad to see Tim Riggins is still finding work!!!!Ôªø
"You call this movie cliche. But you have to stop and remember, this is the tale that CREATED all those cliches that movies have dragged through the mud countless times since 1912. This is the original. Approach it with those eyes and have fun. It should be a good romp. 
And please, read the damn story. It has NOTHING in common with Avatar. Sheesh... Ôªø"
"@Can0fpepsi ....obviously you haven't the read previous comments or you would already know about Edgar Rice Burroughs and ""A Princess of Mars"" the first of 11 novels of the Barsoom series. And as you have prejudged this movie, I see no need to for further discussion with a closed mind.Ôªø"
"@Can0fpepsi the author of the book was Edgar Rice Burroughs. Evidently you didn't care much less bothered to read his book ""A Princess of Mars"". So you're are dead wrong in saying this looks like a rip off different movies as the story is based on a book written and published before movies were common place. Ôªø"
"@geekeing are you talking about a book,an who wrote it? because i really couldn't give two fucks about a book.
an i still don't think this movie is worth watching. looks like a rip off of several different moviesÔªø"
@Can0fpepsi ...so it's of no interest to you that this movie is based on a 11-novel series first published in 1917? Or the fact this successful novel series inspired later sci-fi writers like Ray Bradbury (The Martian Chronicles)...Sir Arthur C. Clarke (2001: A Space Odyssey) or inspired Carl Sagan and others into the fields of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life?Ôªø
"just saw a preview of this in 3D when i was watching Ghost Rider 2, preview looked good , hope the movie is gonna be like that.Ôªø"
"the awkward moment when you realize the director of this movie is the same one of the finding nemo and WALL-E movies,,,Ôªø"
"@dakata13 Much more interesting background and mythology than Prince of Persia -- my guess on the similarity in the looks is that it was the same director; they are both by disney, after all. Ôªø"
"Avatar meets Cowboys and Aliens, dragging with them Prince of Persia and thinking of Star Wars.Ôªø"
@dakata13 Though the same thing. But Jake is way cooler than Taylor here. He looks like a kid:( Now I wanna see Prince of Persia again;) Why don't you make a movie like that again?;(Ôªø
"@greywolf424. Obviously, you didn't read my comment properly at all, retard. Really pitiful. I clearly said, ""initially it started as a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs back in 1912 titled 'A Princess of Mars.'""

Star Wars and Avatar ""ripped it off?"" Please, they were 'influenced' by it!Ôªø"
@zaberfang im just waiting for another trailer and see how it goes.Ôªø
quit trolling and enjoy the trailerÔªø
"@TheSAEkid that's because this movie is based ON A BOOK where the main character is white, if the movie changed John Carter's ethnicity as black, the fans of the books will be enraged. Ôªø"
@Chropoles the plot twistÔªø
LOVE THIS!! does anyone know the release date??Ôªø
"@szotyacid Wasn't it published in 1907? Either way though, yes. This movie is the Great great grandaddy of Science Fiction Heroic Epics. So it deserves to do well and get recognized for that.Ôªø"
"@twist58 WRONG John Carter was written in 1912.... IF ANYTHING STARWARS, AND AVATAR RIPPED IT OFF. Ôªø"
"PRINCE OF PERSIA, FINAL FANTASY & KING SCORPIONÔªø"
@dakata13. I'd say Star Wars (1977) and Avatar (2009) colliding with Prince of Persia (2010)!Ôªø
"@szotyacid. To be more exact, Star Wars came out in 1977 and yes, John Carter came out initially as a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs back in 1912 titled ""A Princess of Mars.""Ôªø"

Damn soo close to Prince of Persia .. like dressing and characters.. eh but still looks interesting :DÔªø
This looks interesting.Ôªø
"@Fakkmalmoe ok the jump is reasonable enough, but im not sure why you compared it to SW. im sure Lucas was inspired by it, he was inspired by lots of things actually. still im just saying the trailer does not spark any interest for me cause of how it is presented.Ôªø"
@Chropoles because its from 1910-1920 and the basis to all sci-fi ect Star Wars wrighter G. Lucas took ideas to Star Wars from these books. And the jump is of the gravity thats on Mars.Ôªø
: O wanna see thisÔªø
Remember: this is not based on a game!!!Ôªø
"well the trailer is great, I hope it doesnt blow like most disney filmsÔªø"
"Bad choice of actress. She looks like  the only fight she's ever been in is over the closeouts at Macy's. If Salma Hyek or Halle Berry are too expensive, they should've gotten an unknown Israeli actress who's actually been in an army!Ôªø"

unless this is starwars 7 i dont wanna hear about itÔªø"
"@szotyacid 
there is also another movie based on that book with the same name Ôªø"
"im always against movie trailers that reveals too much. this on the other hand does not show me anything. perhaps that is good but im not even remotely interested to watch this. the main character didn't even have a dialog spoken in this trailer, instead its disconnected by the narrator's voice forcing down the idea of John Carter is a ""hero"". oh he can jump leap like a superhero at the end, yeah im sure he got this covered, he'll win the war and get the girl. so why watch this movie again?   Ôªø"
"Star Wars: Rip off of the Hidden Fortress (which Lucas references as the inspiration for his star wars films, he was influenced by many samurai films), Avatar: Rip off of Fergully: The Last Rainforest. It's kind of hard for this movie to rip-off anything when the story was written in the earl 1900's...but expecting this CoD generation of retards to understand that is, not-surprisingly, impossible.Ôªø"
"@rico19845 Peter Gabriel ""My Body is a Cage""Ôªø"

"This story precedes Star Wars by many decades, was the inspiration for Avatar and is probably going to be insulted in this movie version...the actual story, if u were to read it, would blow ur mind away, its beyond epic Ôªø"

"@TheKfb2010 Is the book worth reading?? I mean did you like it? The concept seems interesting :)
Ôªø"
"mix of Avatar,Prince Of Persia,Conan,Clash Of The Titans :)))Ôªø"
"i just finished reading the book..hopefully this movie justify it,,,,,cant wait..Ôªø"
@adiavroxos100 And somehow written before either of those things existedÔªø
avatar+conan=jonh carterÔªø
LOL is all I have to sayÔªø
I honestly thought this was atlantic the first time i had seen the trailerÔªø
This looks horrendously cast.  Concept?  Awesome!  Cast?  Terrible.Ôªø
@reivenlocke  Hey I'm a teenager and I'm not bitching about this trailer it's pretty cool so i guess I'm excluded then.lolÔªø
"a little Avatar-like
Ôªø"
I really don't understand this trailer at all...Ôªø
 is  that anothar cawboys and aliens :PPPÔªø
"THis looks like a skinny Conan on mars, killing aliens..
Ôªø"
"How the fuck are any of them alive with so little clothing? It's Mars isn't it.... probably just me but if I was on Mars wearing that... I'd be dead, and frozen...Ôªø"
WTF is that at 1:13?! Is that supposed to be a sadistic bad ass Green Martian? This has the distinct feeling of a classic being ruined to sell movie merchandise... Ôªø
"Now this is real fantasy literature, from one of the best authors in science fiction ever, not overrated popular crap like Harry PotterÔªø"
George Lucas shoulda done this...Ôªø
disney finally got a clueÔªø
"You people have to realize Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote this in 1912. Everyone else stole stuff from his works. Star Wars,Avatar,etc. This is going to be an amazing and very original movie. Ôªø"
..this is gonna be a mad movie!Ôªø
"Duuuude, that reminded me so much of Another World, i always wanted to watch a movie about Another World, but I think I'll me happy enought with this!Ôªø"
"gay
Ôªø"
"@mancalledmars Considering most of the classic Disney movies were based on violent fairy tales (with all the murderous stepmothers and wolves being boiled alive) and those tales were sanitised versions of even older and far more violent folk stories, it's not really surprising.Ôªø"
"this will be the real steel of 2012 , and the amazing spiderman will be the x-men first class of 2012Ôªø"
thumbs up if you think this looks like prince of persiaÔªø
@louielouie11224 theyre all ripping off pocahontas!Ôªø
Prince of Persia +Avatar +Green LanternÔªø
"@gjw000 This is based on a book written before James Cameron was born, if anything, Avatar ripped John Carter off.Ôªø"
Wow. Beautiful song! Ôªø
"@sir2honda Peter Gabriel - My Body Is a Cage

prince of Persia meets planet HulkÔªø
Two words... Final.. Fantasy...Ôªø
@smartfan22 i dont give a shitÔªø
uhm.. anyone else thought of Prince of Persia while watching this? :/Ôªø
"@RaisingTheCrescendo I don't know about that Disney launched some early films that were pretty not-child aimed like fantasia.  And this has been a Disney project for several decades now, so shoe-horning what art the studio makes by wanting it to be all family friendly is absurd.Ôªø"
awesome ;]Ôªø
what a retarded showÔªø
"well, that green martian was a dissapointment... i was so looking forward to this movie when i first heard it was going into production. I read A Princess of Mars when i was fifteen, finished it in two days. then i hear they're making a movie, and i get really excited. then i hear that disney is making it, and the excitement burns out, but i'll still watch it. then i see the green martian in this.... now i'm just fucking dissapointed! should've been made by someone else!Ôªø"

"@ spacegirl996 Disney movies have ALWAYS been violent!!!smh! You have to look close, even if it is entertainment.Ôªø"
pocha-marsÔªø
"Not 1917.  1912.  John Carter of Mars is just as old As Edgar Rice Burrough's other creation, Tarzan.Ôªø"
Get your ass to Mars.Ôªø
"@ahmadhandoma Apparently, because of being raised in the greater gravity of earth, he is stronger and faster than any being on Barsoom (aka Mars.) Look at the great leap he performs late in the trailer.Ôªø"
john carter is he the only character save the world ? Ôªø
AKA hawk-man and Hawk-girlÔªø
@rosepedal911 rofl best comment i read all day :DÔªø
"  :O gambit, how could you? thats wolverines woman!!!Ôªø"
Looks faithful to the novels... Nice.Ôªø
"@smartfan22 
Oh shit, 1917 ? I did not know they had good shit to smoke back then!! Ôªø"
so yah its a rip off of conan the barbarian and the video game prince of persia! idgets!! maybe if some of you bad mouthers were to get off the internet and sit down and read a good book you might have a better understanding of things when they bring them into being motion pictures!Ôªø
"the first book was published int 1917, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the man that  wrote tarzan of the jungleÔªø"
"@JackLivesTogether have you even read the books? conan was a book writen after John Carter of Mars and prince of persia is a videogame, does noone even read or learn any history!! Ôªø"
"I liked the comics as a kid...never read the books but, this looks awful...despite the great addition of Peter Gabriels music.
Ôªø"
The only thing I liked was the song. Ôªø
Conan and Prince of Persia's of MarsÔªø
more like Conan of marsÔªø
I saw this pre-made. It was awsome. Some of the special effect were not done. Like some of the ships. And one scene was a sketch. But still cool. I had to do a survey on it. Like what I liked about and disliked. I was not crap if you asked me and it was one of the few Disney movie that I liked. Actual you sort of cant tell it is a Disney movie. Ôªø
Tron of Persia :DÔªø
"If Tron:Legacy and Prince of Persia are any indication this will be another glossy, slickly marketed vanilla movie for a vanilla Disney target audience.Ôªø"
"They are so many great SF books, why always hollywoods choose this so poor scenarios....Ôªø"
@szkdiablo Looks awesome :DÔªø
Great story. Read it. But don't expect this movie to be it judging by this preview.Ôªø
"I was turned on to the books 15 years ago. OMG this was the Stars Wars of the early 1900! No, better than Star Wars. Read the books and be amazed! This movie,....hmmmm. I'll wait and see.Ôªø"
OMFG is that GAMBIT with WOLVERINE'S girl?!Ôªø
