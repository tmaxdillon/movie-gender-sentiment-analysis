I really love this movie ._Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷_•ÈÀ
I love this movie.. If only they had facebook back then lol. Would have been a lot easier•ÈÀ
This movie is still valid even though we have Facebook because they didn't know their last names..   (^_^)•ÈÀ
The reason I'm here is Calle y PochÌ© ‰ª´•ÈÀ
_Ù÷à_Ù÷à_Ù÷à_Ù÷à (I think serendipity might be my favourite word/thing!)•ÈÀ
1:50 The first measure makes me cry. omg•ÈÀ
only here because of Noah•ÈÀ
"I wanna watch this movieAlso_ÙÕÏARMY_ÙÕÏ•ÈÀ"
Who‰Ûªs here cause of Noah Centineo•ÈÀ
"haha i', surely not the only one here coz of noah centineo....•ÈÀ"

Ishita Patil haha same•ÈÀ
Same!!!!•ÈÀ
Haha same  it‰Ûªs so weird to think I‰Ûªm not the only one!! Lol!! Who else is obsessed with Noah???•ÈÀ
Who?•ÈÀ
Oh why can't guys like him be in NYC it hard being a beautiful single gal in NYC.•ÈÀ
I understand this movie. Same thing is happening to me now. The main characters are crazy and nonsensical just like me. There's this woman that I saw months ago and I can't seem to get her off of my mind. How is this even possible? I don't even know her name.. but there was an instant connection -- it was more spiritual than physical attraction. It's been a month and I can't stop thinking about someone I just met once. It's crazy. But something's telling me; that we will see each other again. I don't know when or how. I just know and I'm positive we will meet again somewhere. This movie is real.. it happens in real life too - it happens to me.•ÈÀ
Ay mej mala meet me at st gallen•ÈÀ
John Cusack brought me here...•ÈÀ
Serendipity Wattapp. ‰_•ÈÀ
anyone else watching this because homestuck•ÈÀ
8 months after Serendipity came out but Im still confused about this _Ù÷â•ÈÀ
why is it that scenes in 0:01 and 0:10 are not in the actual movie. I dont remember those in the movie.•ÈÀ
"SÌ_ em filme mesmo, que vc encontra o amor da sua vida e deixa ele ir apenas por acreditar no destino! O amanhÌ£ pode nÌ£o chegar ame hoje ! _ÙÕÏ•ÈÀ"

"""When destiny has a sense of humor it's called serendipity"". So all my life is serendipity.  Why my chances in life at everything have irony•ÈÀ"
John cusuck....one of the most overrated actors ever.•ÈÀ
Would anyone like to say anything about the movie? Here's the link: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serendipity•ÈÀ
twin flame type of movie•ÈÀ
This movie send such a terrible message.....that it's ok to string others along and have them fall in love with you.... only to break their hearts because of our selfish desires. Horrible horrible message. Life doesn't work this way. Garbage.•ÈÀ
"for me the movie is great :) actually at first i thought it was selfish of them to find each other when they're both engage with different person but overall it reflects human behavior. their personalities was like a mirror to a human soul when it comes to love,  it's either you'll turn yourself to a stubborn looking for your pipe dream or marry someone and pay for eternity of empty-ness that the one you marry can never ever fill (Coz you know even though human beings have some striking resemblance to each other we still do have some differences that makes us unique).  I mean their is no harm in the message of the movie, It just display how our actions affects our future, its all about decision making that we do everyday. and i am not saying go to NY and bump to a stranger days before Christmas, like what Sara said in the movie ""soulmate is a very crucial term to use about what's happening to your life"" but its not a crime to do what makes you happy even if it means breaking your fiance's heart for the fact that you've been dating for like countless years/ living together and he still doesn't have any idea of what your finger's size is (It kinda breaks my heart co'z the movie showed how Lars take Sara for granted). no hate guys just love the movie and NO I didn't come here because of BTS and other stars.•ÈÀ"

That*•ÈÀ
it was her sister•ÈÀ

"SPOILER I didn't find this movie romantic at all, the girl ruined 3 lives because she believed in ""destiny"" and didn't want to give the guy a chance immediately even though she fell for him. And he was with a girl way too good and beautiful for him, whom I seriously felt sorry for but she can do way better anyways. He thought he was in love with Kate Beckinsale's character when it was only physical attraction, he was worried that seeing her after a few years would turn out to be a disappointment if she aged badly, I mean seriously.. People see a romantic movie when this is only about a shallow guy and an indecisive girl. 90 minutes of my life I ll never get back.•ÈÀ"
I feel the same way. I literally only watched this movie for Kate Beckinsale but I hated her character the most.•ÈÀ
@katie George you will never understand...the feeling of this movie•ÈÀ
"@Hamza NoorwalaGiven that that's what I was stating in my comment, you are right.•ÈÀ"
Our brain plays tricks on us. We fall in love of physical beauty of a person. And so we think that is not true love. But we adore beauty. And we contemplate it. We desire it. And there is nothing more natural.•ÈÀ
Maybe Jon and Sarah actually did their partners favors by letting them go rather than staying with them and been in unhappy marriages. Allowing them to be free to find their true soulmates like they had found•ÈÀ
"i think its corny,its just a fantasy and dont believe everything on it..untill it happens to me..serendipity?! seriously?!  oh fck! nooo,shiiit! and said to myself...why now?unbelievable...!!!•ÈÀ"
"Wow,,  jaded much.    What a horrible person you must be to sit next to on an airplane.   Typical American Woman.•ÈÀ"
lol. I agree 100%. sends a horrible message.•ÈÀ
"Katarina G. Some fair points, but there's more to the movie than just that. It'll reach to different audiences•ÈÀ"

"Wow, really. I thought it was two people who love each other so much that they leave every thing. I thought we Indians understand that than anyone else.•ÈÀ"
"there should be a second part, where 1year into the relationship they realize that having such a quirky romantic start is great and all, but people are people and they are not better off than in their previous relationship.•ÈÀ"

"Maine ' Yayadub ' Mendoza, them most influential person of her generation, trendsetter talaga, a perfect example of a person with Midas Touch, anything she touches turns into gold, imagine this movie was released 2001 or 15 years ago and have been completely forgotten, but a mere mention of it by Maine Mendoza suddenly trending agad.... THE MAINE EFFECT.... truly a magnetic, irresistible charm and charisma than only Maine can deliver.... If there's a movie that titled "" There's something about Mary"", a more fitting title would be ' There's something about Maine' !!!•ÈÀ"

This movie came out on October 5 in 2001 i just watched it and it is a good movie but I swear I could see the twin towers in the skating scene at the beginning of the movie boy I wonder how long they stood after that scene was shot maybe a year maybe just months.•ÈÀ
but you love those iraq war movies•ÈÀ
Just watched an interview with Kate Beckinsale where she said they had to digitally remove the Twin Towers after Sept 11 when it was due to be released in theatres due to the sensitivity of the subject matter at the time and that the film actually didn't draw a box office as a result but has accumulated a cult following since then•ÈÀ
"great great movie, is 1 of my favorite movies ever. I consider it a Beautiful movie, I did that trick with the 5 dollar bill, iam still waiting.•ÈÀ"
"I'm not normally a fan of romantic flicks, but I strongly recommend this one. Good music, great acting, and some very memorable scenes.Also, Cool Hand Luke is my favorite movie as well. What a coincidence...•ÈÀ"
"Beautiful movie ,,, love makes life worth living!!•ÈÀ"
cheesy crap•ÈÀ
+bunniewood cheesy yes but good :)•ÈÀ
"This movie has a really dangerous message because it insinuates that your life is all control by destiny which is not true, winners don't let their life be decide by luck.•ÈÀ"
Shut up you mug•ÈÀ
"@MrDampkring True hurts, sorry loser•ÈÀ"
"+agroeconomist 77 OR, if it happens to be the one you find is totally the best thing that could ever happen to you, you could say the stars are looking out for you. That's a good thing in my book :)•ÈÀ"
"@Kate Hu Yeah, but in my point of view, you cannot leave everything to destiny, I mean at the beginning of the movie it was obvious they like each other, but she decide to leave this to ""destiny"", I believe the best way to find love is to follow your guts, not to follow ""destiny""•ÈÀ"
agroeconomist 77 Dangerous message? Your comment is dangerous. It's a movie. A movie is supposed to inspire fantasy. Go take your left brain bullsh*t somewhere else.•ÈÀ
agroeconomist 77 True hurts? What is that suppose to mean? Oh. You mean truth. Got it.•ÈÀ
oh wise one thank you for your brilliant assesment•ÈÀ
"agroeconomist 77 Plus To Me, It's Like Another ""Harry Met Sally"" Reject, But During Christmastime!•ÈÀ"

beautiful romanticåÊmovie.•ÈÀ
"in my world, there is no such thing as a chick flick, there is just good or bad movies. i don't favor one kind of movie gendera over another, i'll watch what i'm in the mood for and if it happens to be a love story then so be it. this movie i liked and i find myself wishing something like this would one day happen to me. and yes, i am a guy.•ÈÀ"
Gerard Butler should have been the lead actor in this.•ÈÀ
"Best Romance Movie i've watched. This trailer does no justice, Definetley worth the watch!•ÈÀ"
"That's so cheesy, I can't even watch the trailer to its end. Eww.•ÈÀ"
I just watched this movie from TV. This was a terrible movie!•ÈÀ
"absurd movie, you don't normally go out with a stranger after picking up the same gloves unless you're in a movie or you're desperate to break up with your bad pick gf or bf. and it ends with corny kiss from d grade actor, john cusack. (d grade actors are actors that can't act and boring but have to fill in the film likeåÊbill pullman, dennis quaid, sam neill, jeff goldblum etc. i would buy it if it's kate and brad pitt.•ÈÀ"
Not all movies have to be realistic!åÊ•ÈÀ
"well everyone has an asshole,,kinda like opinions,,,,John cusack is a pretty good actor, He's no brad pitt , but no one will be like brad pitt,, I live in Brad Pitts hometown , and deff agree that pitt kills it in every movie ,,, but have always enjoyed Mr cusack's movies as well.. Except this movie would deff suck ....cuz of the story,not actors•ÈÀ"
