Did GREASE win any Academy awards?•ÈÀ
"GREASE, some say was testimony to Americans longing for simpler more innocent times. Innocent times? If you wanna call ""making out under the dock"" innocent as John Travolta demonstrated in that ""humping gesture"", okay.This movie might've been an indication that American society was beginning to lose it's innocence at the end of the 1950s and would give way to the not so innocent, turbulent and violent 1960's. Or maybe it was showing that the 50's were not as innocent as people say it was.•ÈÀ"

"I remember being a young teenager and having to have the cool mom say it's ok for us to see the movie. Of course my mother would of flipped out if she knew I saw it, we went so many times to see it. I like the drive in movie advertising with the hotdog jumping into the bun. Grease 2 was terrible it didn't have the ""it "" that the original had!•ÈÀ"
