Nothing can beat this movie it‰Ûªs an original•ÈÀ
Cool edit :)•ÈÀ
I really cried _Ù÷¢_ÙÕĞ_ÙÔ_ÙÔ_ÙÔ_ÙÔ_ÙÔ•ÈÀ
"And the 33 victims actually saw close to nothing of the profits this movie made, nor did the Chilean government help them. Fucking capitalism..•ÈÀ"
The movie was good. But the trailer was pretty gay•ÈÀ
I always think of Daylight & the Sun by Anthony & The Johnsons when this event actually happened.•ÈÀ
Love chile from pakistan•ÈÀ
Aaand it's American.....•ÈÀ
I bet they bate each other arses bloody down that mine!•ÈÀ
33•ÈÀ
This is actually a true story and they filmed it in Colombia in a salt mine true fact I went there on Sunday•ÈÀ
I thought this was going to be a horror movie.•ÈÀ

Trailers shouldn't be this long. Gotta be 30 seconds•ÈÀ
cineva de la backpack your liife?•ÈÀ
"Though I love the song to death, it's no relevant to the movie and the story at all. I love the fact that all loved one of the 33 settled up the camp in front of the mine and name it ""Esperanza"" meaning HOPE. The movie should have used the song about hope. There's nothing to do about ""say something I'm giving up on you "". What??? Giving up?  Nah...•ÈÀ"
Chile•ÈÀ
so.... are they now gonna make a movie about this group of boys that have been stuck in that cave in Thailand?•ÈÀ

"A new movie will be made ""the 13"" if you know what I mean....•ÈÀ"

It's great story•ÈÀ
"y cito: solo sale Antonio Banderas para atraer gente y que la vea, con todo respeto a los mineros que contaron los difÌ_ciles momentos que vivieron, esto no les hace justicia ni mucho menos, solo fue un intento fallido de la pelÌ_cula, la verdad no creo que les hayan dado algo por su testimonio, ni modo, dieron todo por nada, oh es verdad, es la minera verdad•ÈÀ"

I am watching it in 2017 I was wondering if it was a girl or boy•ÈÀ
"Girl!! Her name is ""Esperanza"" (in English, hope).•ÈÀ"
"I remember when this accident happened, and paralyzed the whole country for days, the only thing you saw in news here in chile were updates about the rescue of this people. But this movie is so wrong in so many levels. Starting by the cast, like if here in chile we didn't had any decent actors/actresses to be in a movie. I wonder who decided to make this film in english, because it feels so wrong, most of chileans don't speak english, or barely understands it well.And you know what feels wrong about this movie too? even the dub version has a mexican accent. The only true chilean things that made up to the big screen is freaking don francisco, the empanadas and a song of violeta parra. Very disappointed.This movie could have shown the spirit of chileans in moments of need you know, portraying the real chilean society.•ÈÀ"
ik what this song is but it seems different than the original one and its soo good and i wanna know what its called•ÈÀ
one of the best trailer i ever seen•ÈÀ
I am watching this in Geography xD•ÈÀ
"I believe we will make it out here, because I chose to believe it! All 33 of us.The most impacted line of the movie•ÈÀ"
"The Canadians and Australians showed up, but when you need miners rescued, don't send Subjects of the Crown to do a man's job. MURICA.•ÈÀ"
i crird the music fits the movie so much•ÈÀ
"Being An Mining Student Loved It !!! Thank's for Picking Subjects like These @Warnerbro's•ÈÀ"
"I have see this movie where I have been blessed at the "" Orange County Rescue Mission / Village of Hope in Tustin , Ca. area•ÈÀ"

gringos klos esto paso en chile•ÈÀ
Chileans speaking perfect english... good logic americans åÂåÂ•ÈÀ
Mario Casas deserves more roles in hollywood.•ÈÀ
"I was 3 when this happened, but I still remember my mom and dad watching the news everyday, wondering if they were even alive. I remember the joy of the last man coming out, I still remember when the tube lifted with the last man, god bless them all•ÈÀ"

"i really enjoyed this movie (i have a few tastes in movies, LOVE a great disaster, the more people dying the better, (only in movies, not in real life), I love a good outbreak movie (this kinda ties into the first), and I LOVE a good survival against the odds movies (i.e. apollo 13, 127 hours) The only issue i have with this movie is it's in english (with accents)........er, it took place in chile, it should have been in spanish with english subtitles.•ÈÀ"
i remember when this happend•ÈÀ
Why do some have to press dislike??? 872 are you insane???•ÈÀ

"Steps when a disaster happens1) Put it on the news and charge for commercials.2) Sell merchandise (flowers, candles, cards etc) for people to grieve.3) Open hotline, no profit organisation etc to collect money for the families (use most of it as ""internal expense"")4) Find a kid and rebrand as a miracle. If no kids find someone who helped someone and rebrand as hero. Show off ""hero"" to every possible show on tv. Charge for commercials5) Make song. Sell on itunes.6) Sell services to ""prevent"" similar accidents7) wait for people to forget about it. Then remind them with a movie of the event...This is the beauty of making money out of suffering people. If you remember to toss a dime towards them you are ALWAYS the good guy.•ÈÀ"

I knew it would eventually be a movie, and thankfully it turned out to be with a great cast instead of B-actors and bad cinematography. After seeing  Rodrigo Santoro in 300...total fan.•ÈÀ"

"what's with the need of fake english accent? fuck this shit, they could have perfeclty done this in spanish, fucking brainless hollywood•ÈÀ"
Um they would be brainless if they had an entire 2 hour movie in a different language. The main target audience is English speaking people. They would lose a lot of money if it was in  a different language because no one wants to go the movies and watch subtitles for 2 hours. It doesn't even take away from the story that much for it to be in English. We know they speak a different language it's not like we're ignorant.•ÈÀ
"And they couldn't have done it perfectly because the entire cast would also have to learn the whole script in a different language, it would take twice as long for the movie to actually come out, and then not have anyone watch it because of all the subtitles.•ÈÀ"
"@Ches Wilson first of all, everybody reads subtitles outside the us. It's not hard,  unless you are an an alphabet redneck, just like Hollywood portraits itself. Second,  those actors,  at least most of them actually speak spanish,  but they are acting to speak English with that accent. For me,  it just loses authenticity. And third,  yes,  it takes away a LOT from the story. A lot. Just like when mother fucking warner chanel dubs friends to Spanish for example,  which is awful. And yes,  Hollywood is brainless. They do brainless shit. Do you remember xmen first class when magnetto went to Argentina,  to ""villa gesell"" to find those nazis? Villa gesell is a beach city,  it does no have mountains. They changed tje name of the village, why?  Its like if they went to portland and name it miami. And inside the bar,  the bartender speaks with a clear Mexican accent. I mean,  they go to Argentina and they hire a Mexican extra!  Wtf?? That my friend, IS brainless behavior. And unfortunately, it contributes to the American stereotype of stupidity. •ÈÀ"
"@echelon anglo okay, well let me just say one thing, bringing in where I live and calling itåÊstupid is just shallow and ignorant. i fucking work for Hollywood filmmaking, I think I would know some things about it. second, theres not only americans working on these sets, and with Hollywood, so you cant generalize it. third, im just telling you that there would be a great loss if they had made the movie EXACT. that's why almost all films in Hollywood are changed at least a little bc they cant be exact. we have budgets you know, we cant just take our entire cast, crew, and extras to another county for maybe 30 minutes of a movie. and I know Hollywood, we make stupid decisions sometimes of things to put in movies, but really, you have to think sometimes.•ÈÀ"
"I am thinking dude,  that's why I'm saying this. It's astonishing that Hollywood cannot stand the subtitles,  being that it's not a movie for children. I know that there are people from all over the world in Hollywood, but the roots are from the us. Hollywood is in the us and it's a way the us has to expose itself to the rest of the world. I'm being specific here,  Antonio banderas?  Rodrigo santoro? They speak spanish for fucks sake!  The news lady is chilean!.  About the x men movie,  they went to Argentina,  to the south,  and brought a mexican dude to play the bartender. wouldn't it be easier and cheaper to just hire an argentine extra?  Wouldn't it be less stupid to name the village with its true name rather than with another city's name?.  I know i cannot generalize,  Hollywood has made great and spectacular movies,  but sadly,  this kind of dumb decisions (including the miliking of the same plots over and over again E.g fantastic four) and shitty movies is a common thing lately. I would say that only 10% of Hollywood movies released in the past years are good.  And for the biggest,  richest and most profitable film making industry in the world, is just embarrassing. •ÈÀ"
+echelon anglo i got to agree dith the echelon anglo ches im sorry•ÈÀ
"brian is right lucid dream. u dont understand because u are used to it..if a chinese movie studio made a movie about your home town in cantonese with weird english accents, would would feel that its complete bullshit . put yourself in others shoes•ÈÀ"
Most Americans are illiterate so they wouldn't be able to read the subtitles. I guess that's why they call it a fact-based drama and not a true story.•ÈÀ

"+m. ab they didn't make the siblings' storyline and character development more emphasis. that was the most beautiful part of the movie. i cried for like, 10 seconds when they hugged.•ÈÀ"
"@Jason VargasåÊWell they did go differently. Most of the film, what happened when they were down there after the collaps, is almost all fiction. The miners promised not to tell anyone what actually happened down there so what you saw was mostly fiction. And my point is that while they are at it making things up, they could've made it so much better.åÊ•ÈÀ"

So you're saying your a Republican.•ÈÀ
"+Andy Lavandero What I am saying is, people should cut the hypocrisy.  Stop playing the ""racist"" card when you yourselves have biases of your own.  There is a reason why we prefer living or staying here in the US, rather than the country where our own race is from.  Diversity is good, but it can be challenging as well.  And the US is doing a much better job in providing equality and protection to all its citizens compared to other countries.•ÈÀ"

"If there is a bit of Spanish language spoken in the film, I think it's fine. But if they spoke Spanish the whole film, I wouldn't wanna watch it because it's quite interupting to read subtitle all the time (like ur eyes focus on  subtitle more than picture on screen) Spanish language is beautiful but I don't understand it. And I don't see what's wrong with their accent in this film. I can understand what they speak. I don't know...I watch a movie and decide whether it's shit, ok, or good by considering plots, story timelines, and graphics.

"when from excellent to good!I submit my review to facebook page, their don't like, and the delete my post from their page. I going to write here,, the film is good under the stands , my concerned is the language, as movie lover, and critique, if the real life event happen in Spanish culture with the heritage language is Spanish. As Hispanico I found this very confusing to my soul.. you have spanish and latino actors and actress, you have location (Chile) you every eventåÊhappen in Spanish, Why English.. So I want to remainder the people refuse to tell the history in nature language with not be accept by Golden Globe, and the academic award Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as true film do the language discrepancy. This film had the opportunity to be part of Academy and Golden,The film was having the potencia to become one the Chile historical film, now is good drama film•ÈÀ"
