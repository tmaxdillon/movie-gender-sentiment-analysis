"I don't understand the whole human and animal relationship thing. They can poop and drool in your car, tear up the screens and other stuff around the house, leave their hair all over the place, and smell bad too.  Vet bills are just as expensive as human medical bills, and most don't live too long.I find most humans who have pets, also have emotional or some kind of self-esteem issue in that they need to feel loved by animals. Not to mention all the laws and money needed to protect and shelter animals.  Homeless people wish they had so good. This video isn't funny, its stupid! P.S. I won the challenge.ï»¿"

"I feel bad for the cat who ate cheese. Why? It's because about 80% of cats are lactoseintolerant. (In case you don't know) that means that about 80% of cats gets sick when they eat cheese, or any other dairy product. Hopefully, this cat is not lactoseintolerant. Otherwise, have fun cleaning their litter box.ï»¿"
It's probably too late but Get rid of the cat that got into the crib and took the pacifier. It will kill the baby.ï»¿
Cats getting hurt is kind of sad isnâ€™t funny. And the music could have been something elseï»¿

"Tiger FunnyWorks can you stop with the dum musicï»¿"
None of your videos are funny. Half of the clips are covered by annoying music and are about cats getting hurt either accidentally or by their owners and everyone laughing about it.ï»¿
"Video wasn't terribly funny, but calling people irresponsible pet owners because their cat is growling at a camera? My cat knocked over a broom once ten years ago and he won't go near one to this day. Cats are quirky and irrational just like people. I'm not going to accuse people of animal abuse just because their cat is food aggressive.ï»¿"

God I wish I was there to kick those cats in their fucking faces so hard that they start choking lol once I saw this cat that always was in my neighbourhood I don't know whose cat it was but it came always to my mother and my sister and sometimes to me one day I was alone and the cat came to me and I knew it was my opportunity I played with her a little until she felt confortable ans then I took her by the tail lifted her above my head and smashed her face against the bank we had in the garden the cat just laid there with her face dripping blood and visibly stunned like she couldnt focus on anything probably because the head concussiom was so strong eventually she got up and started to walk funny from link to right I went after her after she walked a meter or so and se wanted to run but failed and fell it made me so angry that she wanted to run from me I took her by the neck amd started strangling her but no I didnt wanted to strangle her I took her tail again and started spinning her hard and fast her tail actually cracked twice or thrice and eventually I hit her head against the stone floor so goddamm hard she didn't say anything and she had her face like completely broken her mouth cracked open dripping with blood her nose completely smashed and black and her eyes void from life she died or was dying in that moment I got rid of her fast in the container I didn't want to bury her too much hassle for a simple cat and I had to clean the fucking floor before my mom came damnï»¿

I felt sorry for these cats. And I agree the music is sooo annoying and we don't need captions we can hear for ourselvesï»¿

The cat snore was funnyï»¿
"What kind of stupid parent laughs when a cat bats at their kids face... Cats always bat at the face of other animals/humans with the intention to claw out their eyes. It's like ""Typical cat behaviour 101"". Maybe in these videos nothing serious happened, but that's because the cats are annoyed and not really scared/aggressive, but even if they don't claw at you seriously, accidents happen. Would the parents still laugh when their child goes halfblind because of their stupidity?ï»¿"

"9:18 is animal abuse. That's bad for their spine! And it's just not wanted by cats to pet their belly when you aren't allowed by them. Don't force them. And sometimes when they show you their belly it's just because they trust you or as greeting, not as an invitation to pet them :|ï»¿"
The cat wasn't even trying to get away.  They put up a real fight if they don't like what you're doing.ï»¿
Can you get away when shocked and when there is a human (that's at least 5 times your size) holding you just at your chest?ï»¿

Why is every one laughing when the cats falls they can hurt them selfs cats donâ€™t always land on there feet _Ÿ˜¢ï»¿
"If they were hurt, they stop doing it.  But they don't.  They jump, fall, jump, fall, jump, fall over and over.  Clearly they're not getting hurt.  You assume that because you would be hurt, they must be also, but cats are different.  God made cats to entertain us.ï»¿"

"You know that if you fell 10 body lengths, you'd be seriously hurt, so you assume a cat would be too.  But it's not.  The cat just shakes it off and he's ready to go again.  That's why even cat lovers think it's hilarious when they fall.ï»¿"

"You clearly don't understand cats... It in fact is abuse.

The sounds aren't funny either _Ÿ˜¡ I don't think you know much about cats. Cuz these are sounds they make when they are distressed/scared. Either because they are eating and being filmed (cameras are scary for cats)/being touched whilst eating or because the cameras are just put in their face.ï»¿

"A lot of those crashes and falls could injure or kill the cat/kitten. Not funny. And the cat swatting at a baby is dangerous- not funny. The cat should not be put into a position of having to defend itself from the manhandling and annoyance of a small child. The adults should keep them separated--not just laugh and  allow the baby to treat the cat like a toy. Cats, kittens, and the baby could be gravely injured by each other. Keep them apart and teach the baby to be very gentle with a pet. Don't use it as a TOY, a stool  or a climbing area.ï»¿"

"You do catch some of the funniest cat moments.  Cool video.The ""weird meow"" in most of those clips is the ""I am about to F you up"" meow of a cat who feels threatened.This video would be better if there were no music or if the music were muted during the parts that feature sounds (weird meows, etc.)I work with cats, and there's nothing wrong with an occasional fall or prank.  Cats are instinctively tolerant of this and they do like to play rough.  Just don't let them get in the habit of scratching or biting people.  Always use a toy when playing (never your hands).  A little teasing is OK, but please give the cat the food/treat when the game is over.ï»¿"

"1:47   That ""weird meow"" is a signal of distress.  Your proximity or the camera is causing that animal to have a fear response.  Is it still funny to know that that cat is being tortured by fear?  This video presentation, with little exception, is glorifying grossly irresponsible pet care.  Thumb down.ï»¿"
I 100%agree with youï»¿

@Valeria Munoz Thanks for your thoughts and your efforts to encourage responsible pet care.ï»¿
InformationIsTheEdge OH!!! Didnâ€™t know :(ï»¿
â€‹@Zainabella Moi  Now you do! :)  Thanks for the note. :Dï»¿
"InformationIsTheEdge you are an idiot. And so are the amount agreeing with you. Youâ€™ve never owned a cat. When cats eat and make noises and are BY THEMSELVES, it means they just enjoy the food. Some cats like to eat. If there is another animal next or a person who is touching the food or them, you can call that a bit of stress. But not when they just enjoy it. So many idiots like you think of themselves as being experts. I recommend raising at once about 25 like I did, connect with your animals and observe them. You will see that same as humans, they are unique react differently. Some cats love water, some donâ€™t. Some will eat Whiskas with chicken and will hate fish and vice-versa for others. Catâ€™s are being stressed by cameras. Some cats will play with them and give a shit about what you hold in your hands.One thing is for sure, cats are never stupid like 99% of humanity isï»¿"
InformationIsTheEdge I agree. People think torturing their animals is funny.ï»¿
this comment is so melodramaticï»¿
InformationIsTheEdge I do agree with you although I donâ€™t think it is irresponsible pet care although you shouldnâ€™t be doing it bc I bet they do take care of there pet and maybe didnâ€™t know what that meant but as long as the cat isnâ€™t always like that they should be dine and if they were always scared or agitated they wouldnâ€™t just sit there and meow a meow is a warning to tell people to stop if he was being bothered that badly he would have bitten or something like thatï»¿

"I agree very much, but if you didn't like it just click off the video.ï»¿"
"@Garfish11 Yes, true, but the thumbnail has nothing to do with my complaint, so I wouldn't know.ï»¿"
"Then just don't watch it. Even a little kitten has to learn, that it hurts, when it falls from anywhere. You can't just hold it every time and everywhere and then, when it is outside and you're not there, it jumps from a tree and dies. It has to learn, that it hurts and it has to learn how to land in its feet. It's a pet and plus, It's a cat. You can't tell a cat what to do. It will do it anyways and has to learn from its own mistakes, like a child. Otherwise it will be the ""stupid fat cat of the neighbours""ï»¿"
Um cats are built in such a way that their legs are natural shock absorbers. They can fall a hell of a lot further without breaking anything or  being hurt in anyway than humans can.ï»¿

@Nihat Hasanov agreedï»¿
"@Tsunami Sue I have two cats and I don't think it's funny. I think people who like it are mean and like animals being hurt. Besides, it's got more dislikes than likes. 18k is a high score for them!ï»¿"

@Nihat Hasanov I really agreeï»¿
"@John Daniel If the cat caused the situation to itself, then you may help IF needed. If the cat can get itself out of the situation, then let it be. The cat will depend on you on the littlest situations. Also, if the cat ever runs away they will depend on you to save them.ï»¿"
"@Nick Park Really??? you think that when they show a ""weird meow"" because an unconsidered human is scratching them the wrong way it is funny AND they did it to themselves, because ""they do what they want to do"". Gee man, are you sure your 11 cats are safe with you? Having a bunch of cats, doesn't mean you can handle them appropriately. And yes, I don't think the videos are as hilarious as described.ï»¿"

"@Elliott the Animator . Whatever. You have your beliefs,and I have mine. I'm sorry you feel that way, because I don't care what anyone thinks negatively of me. I'm a cat lover.

I find some of these super funnyï»¿
"Some are funny, like when the cat was playing by stealing the babyâ€™s shoe, but it does piss me off when people scare their cat or just let them fall and laugh. Like itâ€™s fucked up, would you let your baby fall, get scared, or have to try to talk repeatedly for something they need? Like treat your â€œpetsâ€ù like your family..ï»¿"

@Elliott the Animator I agree whit both its cruel and dumb and mean also makes me mad cause people think it funny when cats fall or fail but it hurts themï»¿
Oï»¿
"well actually, when the cat does the ""no"" meow, it means the cat is either suffering, or calling for a mate. the cats do not  like to be bathed. they clean themselves. i hardly think a suffering cat is funny.ï»¿"

"@sparkle soda life That's okay. One day when you see this dog, coax him (in a soft voice like when you talk to a baby) to you with food and either put him in a kennel carrier or put a leash on him and get him checked at the vet. It's not too late to treat the dog for any other underlying health issues he may have. I commend you for having a caring heart and looking out for that poor dog. Bless your soul.ï»¿"

What is funny about poor cats getting hurt or frightened or stressed out by stupid humans' screeches and totally inadequate actions?ï»¿
"This is why I hate videos like these, 90% of it just cats getting injured or being frightened. And the stupid people filming donâ€™t even try to help the cat or catch it when it falls, instead they just sit there and film it and laugh.ï»¿"

Like at 3:30 that cat is petrifiedï»¿
"not everybody knows when a cat is in distress or is frighted. its not like a cat is going to meow weird and their instantly going to pull out their phone and google what it means. yes the cats could get hurt but hey, their CATS they jump from trees. one of my cats jumped from a tall tree and didn't get hurt. she is still alive. and yes it is funny. you just need to have an opened mind about things like this. ""oh my cat is making an odd noise, im gonna record it and show other people"" is not a crime. it is a-okay.ï»¿"

the worst part of these videos is the comments.ï»¿
"Get a life. Don't be easily misled. I have two cats myself,and honestly,I don't care what that idiot says about this. Wah. Wah.

If this actually were sings of animal abuse,Tiger Productions wouldn't be allowed to be able to film these wonderful and aborable felines.ï»¿"
"@Lps Harsheen That just shows how stupid and ignorant you are. I don't like people who are the pessemtic crowd. They try to ruin it by bringing negative comments like this. Well, it's NOT working. In America,most cat owners and lovers know exactly what they're doing. I seriously don't care what that idiot Elliot the pessimistic persoï»¿"
"-on. It's people like this that makes me wonder why they are allowed to make inane comments. Especially that Laura Aquinas chick,who thinks she's SO much better than the rest of us. Probably racist. I honestly don't care. Cat lovers and owners are of all races,creeds,colors,etthnic groups,same-sex marriages, whatever. Who's gonna contradict them? Nobody, that's who. Try to boycott Tiger Productions all you want, And see if they'll get laughed out of court. Or out of the boardroom. Ain't that funny.ï»¿"

"We raised Hulk after adopting his stray pregnant mother. He is 2 years old and we wanted to give him a companion so we adopted a kitten from SPCA.  They bonded and Hulk cared for him, but the kitten has panleukopenia that we didn't know about. Though he had the vaccine against the virus, Hulk became sick. The doctor misdiagnosed him because he tested negative, and he was in the vet clinic for 5 days without specific treatment and then out of nowhere the doctor said he will die if not taken to the ER for better specialists. For 5 days the vet mislead us that everything will be fine. The lack of proper treatment at the vet clinic put Hulk into liver failure. From the medical chart we saw he wasn't given any nutrition or vitamins through IV, so Hulk being unable to hold any food in was starved for 5 days, his body started eating itself and he developed fatty liver which caused liver failure. We took him and the kitten to the ER, and a couple of thousands later, it seems like the kitten will make it but Hulk needs extensive care for a chance to survive and the hospital  bill is $1200 a day.  I can no longer afford it but also cannot bare the thought of euthanizing him. I cannot stand the thought of him dying with his last memories being locked in a hospital cage after being left to die and starved by the vet. We took him at the early stages so his chances of survival should have been over 90%. If we can come together to raise funds for 3-4 more days in the hospital it would give Hulk a chance to survive.  Hulk only has until Thursday august 30th in the afternoon for funds to be raised.ï»¿"

You don't bath a cat, you don't touch/disturb them when they are eating, you don't just let them fall down for no reason, you don't let a kid bother a cat for no reason, you don't pick up a cat and hold them (so they can't escape) whilst patting their belly (that position is bad for their spine) You DON'T put a camera in their FACE!

"@Laura Aquina(laughs) No, it's NOT abuse,miss. What in the hell do you know anything about cats? I'm not going to argue with you,or to anyone else on how to take care of a cat. Okay?

"What the hell do YOU know about cats? If you can't see this is abuse :| And you don't have any good arguments at all. And you don't want to argue?

And don't you dare call me ""miss"" and then talk shit about me. Totally because my profile picture is that of a boy :| That aside; this is abuse. Ever heard of a spine? Well it can stretch, which is not good, not for cats nor for any living being. If you saw the whole video you have seen the clip at 9:18. That's not good for a cat at all. Totally not because he is not listening to the cat protesting and he's just going on hurting it >.< And about ""playing a game"" Lives are not to be played with, you just don't know how to take care of cats nor any living beings.ï»¿"

"I don't really ever post negative comments, but as someone who works with animals for a living, it makes me cringe so hard to see kids getting swatted at after the cat is CLEARLY showing so many signs that it's annoyed and doesn't want the child to mess with it. Meanwhile the adults are In the background laughing and recording. Neglecting to read the cats body language is putting a child who doesn't know better at risk of getting hurt. My last cat seriously fucked up my eye by batting me in the face. I'm a risk taker when it comes to working with animals, but when a toddler is there, the pet owners have a responsibility to keep the kid and pet safe. Things like that are why children get hurt and pets get surrendered. _Ÿ˜£ï»¿"
People just don't know the glory of a good solid psuedonomas infection. The hard way sure is a certain way to learn!ï»¿

My 2cents worth is that the pet owners need to learn something more about their pets. You can love them and still not know a thing.ï»¿
People are generally stupid.ï»¿
Kayla Crockett so true.  cats can fuck you up!!!!!ï»¿
Personally I don't feel cats are a good idea for children under aÂ certain age considering what can go wrong and how fast it can go wrong. The cat doesn't understand past the fact that it's being bothered and using it's natural way to express that. On the other handÂ the child doesn't understand that they are bothering the cat nor do they understand the harm that can come from doing so.ï»¿
I suspect that many of these cats have been de-clawed. A cruel procedure and illegal in the UK.ï»¿
Its better than beating a catï»¿
"@Cowlover 1 And why would you beat the cat?ï»¿"
"I'm shocked and disgusted to see how callous cat owners are in this video; there's nothing funny and laughable about watching innocent cats get hurt or annoyed, etc. We need to cat proof our environment and give cats safe places to rest and play. It's down right irresponsible, immoral and dangerous to allow little children abuse and harass cats and as a consequence, allow children get hurt and end up getting bad experience and memory of innocent, wonderful creatures. Please show compassion and empathy!!! Otherwise, you don't deserve to own a cat.ï»¿"
"@Narnia Cats love to play, which is really practice for what they do best- hunting. Trouble is there's a fine line between playing with them and teasing them. When a cat's been de-clawed the teaser doesn't learn the hard way where that fine line is.ï»¿"

"@Cowlover 1 I'm sure you wouldn't, but some people would, as you probably know.ï»¿"
"Parents are able to teach kids from infancy how to respect an animal.  We taught our 4 year old simply by moving his hand in a gentle manner and redirecting his attention after so he showed affection in short bursts.  Our cat is 8-9 years old,  and gentle as all getup with him,  but we still made sure to teach him that it is never OK to assume an animal won't lash out.  Today's parents just want to blame any and everything except themselves for their own failures.ï»¿"
@George Knowles declawing is evilï»¿
"@mkg 21 I'm with you 100%.ï»¿"
"You're so rightAnd it's always the pet that gets the blame because it's soooo bad and wild and dangerousï»¿"
"George Knowles It truly is a shame to find most of cats declawed unless is it proclaimed illegal where you live. That was just passed by where I am, sadly it didnâ€™t come fast enough and my parents declawed their two cats, now mine, because they were â€œscratching my sisters eyes out.â€ù Honestly I couldnâ€™t imagine why in any way. She still doesnâ€™t know how to treat an living creature respectfully and Iâ€™m glad the cats now belong with me. It is such a cruel thing to do for such senseless reasons. To all the owners who declaw their cats Iâ€™d love to see them cut off all their fingers and see if they like it.ï»¿"
I agree that's life threatening for the kids I mean like what adult would just stand there recording while the cats hitting the baby on the face and not doing anything but laughing I mean like the cat could really hurt the kid and it will be the parents fault for not doing anythingï»¿

"Exactly. Just like making the weird 'nom-nom' when eating is a warning telling you to fuck off, and when they scratch that certain nerve at the base of their back to make them meow so weird? That's actually painful to the cat. It pisses me off when people get pets and don't know how to treat them or read the signs.ï»¿"

What's with the odd meowing? I cant tell what emotion the cat is feelingï»¿
If youve worled with animals then you could tell that that cat swatting is declawed up front by how swift the paw stroked off the kids head.ï»¿
"I totally agree about this. Toddlers are messing up, and even hurting the cats. The grownups should be capable to take care of the cats, and prevent the toddlers from disturbing them. But what are they doing exactly? Nothing!!! They record a moment when they shouldâ€™ve helped the cats, and they are even laughing when thereâ€™s nothing to laugh about!

It does not look like the cat is enjoying itself. it looks harmless enough, and cat is warning by giving a gentle paw,  but what happens if the cat has had enough, and trying to defend himself, may hurt the child.Of course, the cat will probably be the one to get punished or lose its home.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PARENTS.  WHAT IS SO FUNNY ABOUT A CAT MISSING THEIR TARGET, AND FALLING?ï»¿"

"Does nobody else clip their cats claws? Seriously, my cat isn't de-clawed, but I keep them trimmed same as my dog...he can smack anyone he wants, and he does, we play peekaboo around corners...when I say BOO! He bitch slaps me and I laugh and we keep playing...there are ways to keep pets claws from hurting a kid without declawing.And on the note of declawing, I have seen a case where the person lived in a house with a lot of carpet, and a crazy cat. They had 2 options, replace all the carpet, give it no scratching posts and sit on furniture it cant scratch, or declaw the cat so it would stop breaking its toes when it would get stuck and twist around like a maniac...Sometimes...it's just a medical thing. but clipping claws is always the better option. Shit grows back.ï»¿"

Slap the cat in its face when it tries to scratch or bite out of nasty attitude (unless u srs provoked it) and itâ€™ll learn whoâ€™s boss. And it wonâ€™t be scared of you either.. they donâ€™t get emotional like a dog would be if you beat it they know when theyâ€™re being little twats and I actually love cats because theyâ€™re just that smart. This applies to cats who have unprovoked mean streak not the friendlier ones..ï»¿"

@Beatrice Cameltowe wrong - all wrong! If a cat keeps scratching everywhere it is bored out of its wits! Yoj should not keep a cat then. Clipping or declawing is just torture! If you are not willing to  spend time with your cat then don't get one! And a cat should be allowed to go outside and of course it should be sterilized - cat as well as tomcat!ï»¿
@Sarah Morton don't put your eye near the claw - that easy it is!ï»¿
"@Freiya2011 Seriously? you're trying to say that trimming an animal's claws is wrong? Not a chance I will believe that. My cat has every toy, gets played with by us daily, has a dog he plays with when we are at work, HE has better health coverage than most Americans because I have pet insurance (I'm in Canada)..we clip the tips of his claws because he has tiny razor blades in his paws because he's a domestic carnivorous predator...He can do damage, so just like it's bloody painless to clip your nails, I will clip his. He no longer snags his claws on the carpet while running around doing cat things and follows that snag with a blood curdling screech...he no longer gets stuck to his scratching post and let's out helpless meows until we can help him. He no longer damages my dogs eyes accidetally while they play...he's happy and healthy and he isn't de-clawed. My cat has a pretty charmed life. Don't try to tell me that clipping the sharp ass tips of his claws off is wrong...its part of responsible pet ownership.ï»¿"
"@Chrystal Cribbs not necessarily, I mean totally could be declawed, but in my personal experience, my cat swats without the use of claws most of the time and he isn't declawed. Some cats just wanna give a warning swat first. He often does this to me when we play peekaboo around corners and I surprise him, he bitch slaps me lmao, but no claws and we keep playing.ï»¿"
"@Beatrice Cameltowe Yes, that's wrong doing it on a CAT. A cat normally gets rid of surplus claw substance by itself - sharpening its tools by scratching trees ...you degrade a beautiful hunter to a  toy. That's not animal-love, thar's selfishness! Btw...two cats are living with me. I never would dream of ""de-arming' them because we treat each other in mutual respect! It's simply not necessary! And they need their claws to do what they are born for: hunt!And if you can't make sure that your cat CAN go outside so that it is condemned to a flat-life within walls like a prisoner - then DON'T own a cat! THAT would be a responsible thing to do!ï»¿"
"@Freiya2011 LOL!!! Well thankfully you have literally NO POWER to change that and I'm going to keep harmlessly clipping my cats claws LITERALLY for his SAFETY and the SAFETY of my dog...as well as any child in my house. By your logic...you're imprisoning your little hunters keeping them as your pets you selfish monster! lmao. My cat plays with the dog, and he uses claws if they're not clipped. You seriously want me to jeopardize my dogs vision for that? You're insane if you think for a single second that I would ever consider jeopardizing my dogs vision over something that my cat actually ENJOYS and purrs through. Whatever you want to believe, fine but for the rest of the sane pet owners out there, clipping your cats claws is a really great alternative to watching them hurt themselves and others be it intentionally or accidentally through natural play time. Don't believe me ASK A VETERINARIAN!!!ï»¿"
"@Freiya2011 Also, it's mandatory that cats from shelters are INDOOR pets. He can be taken away if I fail to adhere to that contract...we supervise his outside time, also, this is Canada...its -40 Celcius or colder in winter, he doesn't need to be outside in that weather...What I'm getting at...he has NO NEED for those claws, his charmed ass life doesn't require him to fight for anything. He and the dog roll around and play all throughout the day and guess what, THAT'S WHAT ANIMALS DO!!! So if you think clipping his claws is wrong because he's a cat...you tell me another way to prevent that cat from BREAKING TOES if he gets caught on something or how to prevent him from blinding my dog while they play? There isn't another option and I'm not gluing nail caps on him. Don't try to tell me how I treat my pets is wrong when I have a happy, healthy tabby boy that once a week gets the sharp tips clipped off (with proper claw trimmers for cats that cut properly and dont crush the nail like nail clippers can) so he can run around and enjoy his life without inflicting pain on himself or others.ï»¿"
Freiya2011 I was petting her and out of know where she attacked me and she went straight for my eyeï»¿
"@Sarah Morton It might be difficult to do it when you start, but if you can try just clipping claws sometimes it helps, I understand it's not always an option, but talking to your vet about it and getting the tiny cat claw clippers from the pet store can really make a big difference. All I read was this latest comment so I dont know the whole situation and this might not apply but figured I'd spread the good word LOL :)ï»¿"
"Beatrice Cameltowe you are a very nice person and Iâ€™m being serious a lot of people would comment in a mean way but you are more of compromising person instead of someone that argues and trust me I did want to trim the claws ,but my mom didnâ€™t know how and she was afraid if we took her to the vet they would say â€œsorry, we need to put her down sheâ€™s just really oldâ€ù we did eventually and they ended up saying that ,but now we have a dog named Duke and heâ€™s a Vizsla lab mix ,but we still miss are cat ,she'll remain in are hearts. Bye have a good day or night and donâ€™t know what time youâ€™ll be reading this.ï»¿"
"@Sarah Morton I'm sorry to hear that, Sounds like a really crappy situation. But, I'm sure you gave the kitty the best life you could. And thanks :) you have a good day/night as wellï»¿"

"Exactly, this one video this 3 year old girl was being hated on for softly slapping a cat, and people were threatening to kill her or the mother. And the cat was attacking her and people thought the cat was being a â€œgood kittyâ€ù for doing that. Messed up.ï»¿"

"@JayTor2112 Like fucking washing your cat for example??? You don't do that. Holding them under a faucet, not letting them go... Those kinda meows are tainted with fear, that's why they sound so â€œfunnyâ€œ.ï»¿"
That's exact;y what I was trying to say. There is nothing funny in causing an animal to feel fear. If some people need that explained to them then the fault lies with them because they are psychopaths who enjoy the suffering of animals and people.ï»¿

Blythe Foley You obviesly either have never owned a cat or dont know much about them but in case you didnt know cats are supossed to be bathedï»¿
Blythe Foley thats not abuse your supposed to clean your cat... and its normal if it has fear its completly normal because most cats are afraid of waterï»¿
You guys have the wrong definition of animal abuse when it comes to bathing catsï»¿

"How are some of those cat videos abuse? None of these are about cats or kittens being abused. That's not true. I'm a cat person,and I do know animal abuse when I see them on YouTube. You don't ever want to see those if you can't take it psychologically. Don't see them if you're not ready to confront against animal abuse  of any kind. But these? No,no,no. That's not abuse. Felines can be unpredictable. These cat videos are the light-hearted kind. Not the kind where you see them treated like stuffed animals, being catapulted into the air on purpose, deliberately being ""drowned"" on purpose,as if were a stupid game. Because it's NOT like that.ï»¿"
Agree _Ÿ˜¥ï»¿
"Julio Martinez Wrong! You're wrong! You encourage animal cruelty and say you're a cat person??... who must enjoy seeing cats in frightful stressful situations they never deserve. Ailurophile's don't say what you said. You claim to love cats, but it's obvious your comments reveal more than who you pretend to be. Saying no, no, no, doesn't make something change just because you say it should. Denying any form of animal cruelty doesn't mean it's not animal cruelty, and saying it isn't when the abuse is clearly shown in this video recording is completely nonsensical.ï»¿"
"Whatever. You can say whatever you want ; and act like you're SO goddamn superior to me. As an American citizen,Ilike anyone else,can express whatever opinion I wish, whether anyone agree or disagrees on my views. So,to answer your pessimistic and negative opinion,Sarah R.,(waving my left hand dismissedly) I'm am a serious cat lover. Why don't you lighten up? I don't care what you think of me. It's a funny comment something from people from the likes of you.ï»¿"
"To the people who think you should bath a cat: You shouldn't! They don't like it and it doesn't make them any cleaner than when they clean themselves. Unless ofc your cat is muddy because it has been playing outside (or when it is older, has fleas etc) Cat spit is very clean and antibacterial. And if they eat a little bit of grass now and then, they won't have problems with hairballs (unless your cat is long-haired, because then it might happen a few times) Washing cats isn't gonna make them happy nor clean. They won't trust you as much anymore either. Do you think a wild cat (tiger, lion, cheetah etc) is gonna bath themselves in a river? No! It doesn't have any use, because they can just groom themselves because that's natural, clean etc. (Sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, English is not my mother tongue)ï»¿"
"You should wash a cat if they are an outdoor cat with flea washes and I'd do the at least once a week if you want to do an indoor cat I'd say two times a month and go slow don't just force them into the water, also think about cats in the wild they ain't taken no baths _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"
"@Laura Aquina (groans,snickers....then laughs) Taking a cat a bath is necessary,once in a while. For hygienic reasons. And believe me, it's no picnic. That cat,my me - me also! ow,of ten human years old, starts clawing at me,and then starts freaking out. Then when I start bathing for _Ÿ˜_,that kitty starts biting me. That's when I wisely back off. My black and white beloved cat had never done that before. That's NOT animal abuse, friend. I got compassion and plenty of experience of appreciating cats,thank you very much. I don't have to argue with you. I've seen people that are cruel to both cats and dogs. And any other kind of animal. By kicking them, hitting them with blunt objects, throwing hard objects right at them. Some hoodlums who were downright cruel,had broken some poor cats neck years ago. It happened one night. In 2000. And when I had come to investigate,I had been heartbroken. And cried my eyes out. I had hated that. And it haunts me to this day. October 15,2018. THAT'S animal abuse. Obviously,you don't know what you're talking about. I'm an adult,miss,so don't think you can outsmart me. YOU CAN'T!ï»¿"
"@Julio Martinez I'm sorry, but I don't think cats need baths for hygienic reasons. They can clean themselves. And don't you say you don't want to argue with me. With placing this comment you start an argument with me :| I know that kicking, hitting and throwing things at them is animal abuse. But that's no reason this can't be either. And yes, some cats need baths, because of flees, old age and such. But if you just want to bath a cat because you think they can't clean themselves, and they don't want it, it's abuse. I'm not gonna say anything more, because you will not believe me either way. But, I will say this: don't just assume peoples gender. Now I don't mind getting called miss, but other people  will absolutely hate you if you say it wrong. (And the fact that you say I can't outsmart you because you are an adult is crap. There are kids that are smarter than a lot of adults. Not me though :|)ï»¿"
"@Laura Aquina Hey. You can say WHATEVER you want. Because as an American,I sure do have the constitutional right to express my own opinion (or opinions) whether anyone agrees or disagrees. So,that been said, I can say whatever I damn well please. Who's going to contradict me? Nobody. You're not the only person who doesn't have hardly any knowledge of responsible cat owners. Say what you will about me,for whatever reason,but it'll go in one ear and out the other. Who's going to stop me from me simply expressing my opinion. Because it's MY opinion. And regardless of you or anyone says,I'm entitled to it. I can take my own two cats a bath twice a year,if I want to. I'm paying for them to take good care of them by taking them to the vet. And I DO have respect for animals. You have a nice day. Or evening. Night. (Or life. Please get one.)ï»¿"
