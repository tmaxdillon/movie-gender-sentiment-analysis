"SPOILER ALERT WARNING! For those who experienced and knew of Selena they way I did...Never knew of Selena... Never heard about her. My mom made me sit down and watch Selena in my teenage years. When I heard the song ""I Could Fall in Love"" I knew of her and wondered what were some of her songs were then in the 2000s. Then I saw the tragic death scene, heard ""Dreaming of You"" and I cried. Somebody with so much talent and not only a beautiful heart, but a beautiful soul. I could listen to her music all day everyday. I think of her as what could have been... and she would have been huge. RIP Selena. May your legacy always live on <3•ÈÀ"

"La pelÌ_cula es buena, pero no tan buena, tiene defectos obvios, y el hecho de haber descartado a las personas que audicionaron y quÌ© se parecian mÌÁs a los reales me enoja, y contrataron actores reales que a excepciÌ_n del que interpreta al esposo de Selena,  Jennifer Lopez, y la hermana de Selena, la cagaron con sus apariencias, habÌ_a personas que de verdad se parecÌ_an, la regÌ_ el director y me enoja!!!•ÈÀ"
"Jennifer Lopez fue la ideal, por algo la nominaron al GOLDEN GLOBE y esta pelÌ_cula sigue recordÌÁndose. Donde si la regaron fue en Yolanda y Suzette que no se parecÌ_an nada, a Yolanda la pusieron muy Vieja cuando ella tenia 31 aÌ±os cuando mato a Selena, y a Suzette la pusieron Blanca y muy Comica, cuando en la vida real es muy seria, enojona y morenita.•ÈÀ"
"beautiful beautiful soul! I love Selena! Its so sad how young she died, she didn't deserve it. Only God knows what went down that day and how much Selena suffered :( I will always be a fan. <3•ÈÀ"

This movie does teach me a life lesson is to be careful who you trust. Even though the person (like Yolanda) had no criminal record anyone can be a killer. Always check their background and listen to your surroundings.•ÈÀ
Serena Camilo true!•ÈÀ
how is this not on Netflix?•ÈÀ
Rip my idol I love you•ÈÀ

"Rose‰Ûªs Vids :D that may be true but it doesn't soften the pain of her being gone, or the hatred toward Yolanda for taking Selena's life•ÈÀ"
"The hatred is understandable. Saldivar basically took the life of someone she had claimed to love like her own family, all because she got caught stealing from her. Someone like Saldivar gives all fans a bad name.•ÈÀ"

"""...the story of one of the american brightest stars..."" I was like excuse me but she was half mexican and most of her songs were strongly influenced by latin music•ÈÀ"
"She was American. Born and raised in Texas. Her heritage was Mexican. Even then, she was brought up like a typical American kid. English was her first language. She learned her Spanish songs phonetically, but when she was older she learned to speak the language fluently.•ÈÀ"
She definitely could have been a huge star in America had she lived. Her record label clearly thought so. She was in the middle of recording her first English album when she was killed.•ÈÀ

Jennifer Lopez and Angelina Jolie were both at their prettiest when they played Selena and Gia Carangi•ÈÀ
It's crazy I never seen this trailer but after watching it I feel like I watched the entire movie•ÈÀ
"This is the classic trailer !!!! This is a jewel !•ÈÀ"
The lady who played Yolanda in the movie looks way to sweet to be the real Yolanda•ÈÀ
I know!•ÈÀ
"Sarabi Queen Yeah but remember, this is exactly the way Yolanda acted with the family, all sweet and nice til she couldn't use them anymore then it was bye bye Selena. If I can't have you to use anymore then no one will either. A true obsessive Pyscho nut.•ÈÀ"
"Notice in the scene where Selena and Yolanda are getting pedicures, the 2 of them are cutting up having a good time, a few other people come up to Selena to talk to her, and Yolanda won't stop pestering Selena to pay attention to her. The Quintanilla Family says that's the way Yolanda was toward Selena if anyone came up to Selena.•ÈÀ"
"Selena will never be forgotten ever . I‰Ûªm still sad till this day that she‰Ûªs gone .. but she left us her music , her legacy ‰_•ü . Yolanda took her life and I don‰Ûªt believe anything she says with her lies .. I know deep down she didn‰Ûªt shot her by accident as she claims . And my big question is if she didn‰Ûªt want to hurt Selena why ? Did she had a hi where the place they wanted to meet and when Selena got shot how come she didn‰Ûªt help her ? Wasn‰Ûªt she a nurse ? It makes me so angry that Yolanda killed a innocent soul , with a pure heart of gold and love away from us . Yolanda will forever be hated by millions of people . Selena will always be in our hearts and her legacy will forever be live•ÈÀ"
I'm still sad over her death_Ù_¥•ÈÀ

I still don‰Ûªt get why she killed her she didn‰Ûªt accomplish nothing that was a dumb move•ÈÀ
"+Shamia Fleors Jealousy, because she knew Selena would catch her stealing the money, pure hate.•ÈÀ"
"Shamia Fleors If she couldn‰Ûªt have her, then no one could.•ÈÀ"
"I believe it was out of embarrassment that Selena, someone she clearly had an obsession over, had basically caught her stealing from her and it was as if Saldivar felt at that moment she couldn‰Ûªt live without Selena as her friend.•ÈÀ"
She is so beautiful with a beautiful smile what kind of a old lady will kill Selena the queen•ÈÀ
Ashley TVStar Selena‰Ûªs murderer was only 11 years older than Selena was. They hired an older actress because there simply weren‰Ûªt a lot of Latina actresses working in Hollywood at that time that looked like Yolanda Saldivar.•ÈÀ

I remember watching this movie when I was little some of the parts I laughed my butt off like when she was wearing a bousdiea and her dad was like what is that and when they were trying g to get a car to pull over for them and they were like was them at Selena but other parts I was balling my eyes out•ÈÀ

Selena is probably one of the most shocking and tragic deaths of all time. It‰Ûªs so sad that her being trusting and generous enough to take one of her own fans under her wing caused her own premature demise.•ÈÀ

She had so much to live for.•ÈÀ"
yolanda said i would never take anything from selena well you took away her life•ÈÀ

Omg. Same•ÈÀ
MEXICAN-american please•ÈÀ
"She was of Mexican descent, but she was born and raised in Texas to American-born parents at that. Not to mention, she was raised like a typical American kid and listened to what was popular in the mainstream at the time (e.g. Donna Summer). English was also her first language; she didn't learn to speak Spanish fluently until she was an adult. At any rate, her nationality (the nation to which she belongs) is American.•ÈÀ"

Johnny Carpio well I would too wouldn't u•ÈÀ
"The movie was filmed just a year after her death, and a lot of the crowd extras (e.g., the Houston Astrodome scene) were real Selena fans, so, yeah.•ÈÀ"
Johnny Carpio I honestly wouldn't blame them•ÈÀ

Bianca Ramirez 27•ÈÀ
Chinenye Kalu Oh wow.  she was the same age as i am now when she played Selena in the movie•ÈÀ
she was 26•ÈÀ
"Jennifer Lopez was born on July 24, 1969. SELENA was filmed in late 1996, starting in September. She would have been 27 by then. Selena was 23 when she died two weeks short of her 24th birthday. Interestingly, Selena was nearly two years YOUNGER than J.Lo. She was born on April 16, 1971 and would have been 25 when J.Lo made the movie.•ÈÀ"
same age as chris I think•ÈÀ
love this movie•ÈÀ

even the trailer is sad_Ù÷_•ÈÀ
"Vanessa love Sadly, it's almost impossible to talk about Selana without talking about her death.•ÈÀ"
Vanessa love tell me what happened?•ÈÀ
Candy JimÌ©nez it‰Ûªs hard for me to say it but I will. Selena was murdered by her fan club president by a gun shot 23 years ago on 3/31. I wasn‰Ûªt born yet but I know the story. It‰Ûªs tragic _Ù÷_. I‰Ûªll be 22 in June and I‰Ûªm thankful that I‰Ûªm piecing the details out.•ÈÀ
I know who shot Selena. It's Yolanda•ÈÀ
Candy JimÌ©nez yep! Yolanda needs to rot in hell for what she had done tbh.•ÈÀ
Amazing movie!•ÈÀ
you know @1:57 you can almost can see the resemblance•ÈÀ
"telbi yano Yeah, esp when she's getting into the bus but she stops and stares at the the couple kissing. With the short dark hair and the way her face is posed, yeah she looks just like the real deal.•ÈÀ"
I was at my house with mommy and my sis and dad they drive and went to Meijer s and got everything and a movie dics all Selena for me and they went home I was happy so o got da movie of Selena Peres dis is my mom's password but my real name is Zoey eleanor Babich I'm 9 I'm in 3 grade yay•ÈÀ
I'm surprised Selena isn't on Netflix yet.•ÈÀ
Ana Johnson it was until they decided to take it off _Ùªã•ÈÀ
Sophi Love when??? I'm always on Netflix•ÈÀ
"Ana Johnson it not ,I'm surprised I love Selena•ÈÀ"
It's in Amazon Video•ÈÀ
It's On HBO now•ÈÀ
Ana Johnson Right??•ÈÀ
It was on HBO ch 507 tonight. I remember when it came out her fans thought Selena was pregnant when she died because of the part of the movie when she tells her mom she and Chris are trying to have a baby. Chris said Selena was not pregnant but that part in the movie made people think she was.•ÈÀ
"Ana Johnson Me too Ana me too....._Ù÷Ó_Ù÷Ó_Ù÷Ó_Ù÷Ó•ÈÀ"
"Because of that, I got it in VUDU! Try it it's really cool!•ÈÀ"
I know!!!!! Does anyone know when they took it off Netflix???•ÈÀ
"Sattnin77 I think she said, ""After the tour Chris and I want to start a family.""•ÈÀ"
Ana Johnson ong bro•ÈÀ
It was actually•ÈÀ
ikr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!•ÈÀ
Jupiter Stars It was in 2016. I remember always watching there :((•ÈÀ
It was just the Selena documentary not the actual movie•ÈÀ
Patricia Vargas What documentary? Because the movie with Jennifer Lopez was there too. I watched.•ÈÀ
Sattnin77 Interesting so that's how those rumors got started. It amazes me how people can't differentiate between someone saying they want to start a family and actually being pregnant.•ÈÀ
She is actually! Well on fire stick on kobi•ÈÀ
Ana Johnson It finally is love. Watched it again today. One of The  best movies ever•ÈÀ
"bob skinner I‰Ûªm not able to find it on my Netflix•ÈÀ"
What about Hulu?•ÈÀ
"Most relatable comment I've ever seen, I agree it should•ÈÀ"

"That's why many of us need to join with  Monique by boycotting them.Remember that anti-Native American  movie that Adam Sandler was making in 2015??•ÈÀ"

I wish I have a time machine to go back when at March 31 1995 to save selena from yolanda•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins that makes the two of us ‰÷_•ü_Ù÷Ó•ÈÀ
"Zhariah Collins no then u will change present music, maybe no more Justin beiber or Nicki minaj•ÈÀ"
hmmm... then I would really like @Zhariah Collins to go back•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins me too•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins same•ÈÀ
Jose Cuevas perfect•ÈÀ
"Zhariah Collins unfortunately that could have serious consequence, cant deny that i javent thought about that my self.•ÈÀ"
and Jenniffer LÌ_pez wouldn't have become famous.•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins. Take me with you. I want to see her again.•ÈÀ
"I would look into the window to see if it was deliberate, then go back in time again and stop it :P•ÈÀ"
Zhariah Collins  so true _Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷_•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins For reeeeal!!!!!! Gooood!!!!!•ÈÀ
Jose Cuevas Dude whats wrong with you?!?!? May be they will still be here!!!!!! But the most important thing is that she will be here!!!!! She was humble and sweet!!!!!•ÈÀ
Jeaustin NuÌ±ez Well. There you got a point!!!!! May be she still would have!!!!! Although this did skyrocket her career including her singing for herself!!!!!!•ÈÀ
Jeaustin NuÌ±ez she was made famous by me familia•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins anyone else but Selena whyyy??!•ÈÀ
SAME•ÈÀ
"""That makes two of us"" DEFINENTLY!!! Every thing for SELENAS!!!my queen its either everything...or everything!!!!Because anything for mynqueen Selenas forever Selena...we ALL miss you so much....trust no PUTA!!!_Ù÷¢_Ù÷Á_Ù÷Á_Ù÷¢_Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷¡_Ù÷¡_Ù÷±_Ù÷¬_Ù÷Ï•ÈÀ"
Emily Lopez Well actually someone else in place of Selena no. Its still a life loss. How about just no deaths then.•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins Same here•ÈÀ
ME TOO I wish someone could time travel to prevent that from happening... even if I had't been born yet. I mean think about how much happier we'd be if she was still here.•ÈÀ
"+Zhariah Collins need someone to get you to the Days Inn hotel? That'll be me, I'll drive you there. Cause I am so freaking mad and I hate Yolanda•ÈÀ"
We all wish we could of i remember crying a little girl saying I wish I could of Saved her but my mom said you were little girl you couldn‰Ûªt you do nothing•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins Same here•ÈÀ
Tonai Davis theirs a theory that says that even if we were able to time travel to the past what happened would still happend cause we can‰Ûªt change the past ...•ÈÀ
So would I•ÈÀ
That's exactly what I'm thinking!•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins and Tbunny2905 that makes three of us!•ÈÀ
Jose Cuevas I'm fine with that•ÈÀ
Zhariah Collins I wish that too and I will really shoot the one who shot her•ÈÀ

Jose Cuevas I don‰Ûªt like those singers•ÈÀ
Cutiepututie 18 OMG GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE I HAD THE SAME IDEA THATS JUST AWESOME•ÈÀ
I would jump in front of the bullet•ÈÀ
They need to make a movie out of Chris' book TO SELENA WITH LOVE. The problem with the original SELENA movie is that it focused too much on her father. He controlled everything.•ÈÀ
BUT thats the truth. He was their manager..............•ÈÀ
"Yes, he lived his dreams through his daughter. But the movie is still told from Abraham's patriarchal viewpoint.•ÈÀ"
"They were! Except, Abraham didn't want to so he sued Chris! He sued Chris when he should have been suing MariÌÊ Celesete atiogltffjfgfgdutdi or whatever!•ÈÀ"
"Messylin Actually they did want to center the movie of 'Selena' towards her love life but they couldn't get much support for her husband Chris except a few scraps here and there. During this time Chris wanted to keep his and Selena's private affairs to himself. He was not ready then to share it. As for Chris's book and his wanting to have a tv miniseries from it, well according to Chris the family was okay with the book. But the court Affidavit seem to suggest differently so I don't know. A.B. the brother said that he was okay with the book. Its the father that has a problem with everything. But I blame Chris bc he should've never signed the contract giving his part of Selena's legacy away to the father. It has come back to haunt him. This is why Chris claim to not like dealing with contracts bc he know he screwed up in that area big time. So now all we can do is wait and hope but I fear Abraham has already put a cabosh on it. Oh well, time will tell, it always does.•ÈÀ"
yolanda fat ass killed her i hate her so much she should have never been stealing money in the first place with her broke ass i hope she gets what she deserves in prison because selena didnt deserve that she wasnt a true friend to her real friends wouldnt have to steal or kill over money and now selena's gone over some fuckin money _Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷__Ù÷_•ÈÀ

jesusbar313  lol_Ù÷â_Ù÷â_Ù÷â•ÈÀ
Desmond Turner if only the only bad thing about Yolanda was being a fatass•ÈÀ
Desmond Turner what makes you better than her if it was deliberate?•ÈÀ
Joshua Labrada Yolanda blamed Selena's father for her death. Yolanda was a nurse so she KNEW where to shoot her to kill her. And to make matters worse she's STILL trying to drag Selena till this day lying on her even though she already took her life. Not much of a comparison.•ÈÀ
You were in the room when it happened right? You were with Yolanda every time she checked her email? You were with her when she allegedly wrote the checks? How do you know she's lying?•ÈÀ
you dont•ÈÀ
"papa Yolanda is in jail certainly but she is getting out on a date I forgot :\•ÈÀ"
"march 30, 2025•ÈÀ"

Such a beautiful talented girl who had it all & was about to start a family. All ruined by a mentally disturbed obsessed old lady -_-•ÈÀ
keepin itreal the funny thing is she was not old lady she was in her early 30's she was in love with her•ÈÀ
hala Martinez Well she sure didnt look like she was in her  30's seriously!!!!!•ÈÀ
+keepin itreal Yolanda said that Selena was pregnant when she shot her. She should be in jail on TWO murders because of that!•ÈÀ
Warren Winston Selena wasn't pregnant•ÈÀ
oh oops my mistake +Bangity Bang•ÈÀ
deciaria que la volvieran adar para recordar su vida cada paso que dio es una gran cantante aun esta viva en cada canciÌ_n•ÈÀ
If it wasn't for selena's dead jennifer lopez would be working at mcdonalds!•ÈÀ
It's a possibility.•ÈÀ
How do u figure that? This role started her fame but had Selena still been alive & there was no movie J-lo would've done other stuff in Hollywood. That's not nice•ÈÀ
Chris Lopez thats not what this is about. Jennifer is still a talented woman and she wouldnt have been able to continue her success from the movie if she had no talent!•ÈÀ
Lucy Mcgillicuddy it was by doing this movie that Jlo decided to pursue a singing career. It was also her breakout roll•ÈÀ
She would still be famous if Selena was still alive.•ÈÀ
Chris Lopez not really because jennifer was already working in film and tv when she got the role of selena. She just would have gotten famous  from a different movie.•ÈÀ
Latifa  thank you!! my thoughts exzactly•ÈÀ
"Jennifer would not be famous as a singer if Selena was alive. If anything, Jennifer would only be known as an actress.•ÈÀ"
Messylin Ummmm I agree and disagree. i think she still would have been a singer but she would have started later in life.•ÈÀ
Chris Lopez ha!!!scrub...•ÈÀ
The memes...•ÈÀ
"jlo would not be successful if she did not have talent, because she only became famous because sometimes this and many other very well made papers.•ÈÀ"
"She was already a back up dancer for Janet, New kids on the block, was a fly girl and stared in a couple of movies. And you are ?•ÈÀ"
Chris Lopez You are a hater and haters gone hate. JLo laugh's all the way to the bank. _Ù÷Û_Ù÷Û_Ù÷Û_Ù÷Û•ÈÀ
omg please! _Ù÷Õ_Ù÷Õ get over yourself already _ÙÓ_•ÈÀ

"...this...i dont know what to say bout thisshe was very young, she ws married...hell she was thinkin bout havin a babyTHEN THAT OLD BITCH YOLANDA whats her name came up and shot her bullshitting everyone by saying she didnt mean it when THE OLD BITCH REALLY DID CUZ SHE WS ROBBIN SELENA OF HER MONEH•ÈÀ"
I don't think her & Chris would've lasted anyway. She was having an affair a year before she passed :/•ÈÀ
keepin itreal She was?•ÈÀ
@Clare SangeråÊSadly yes :/ look up Selena affair. It was a plastic surgeon in Mexico. That old hag said that was the only secret I kept from her•ÈÀ
"keepin itreal It's just all lies, she is mentally ill.•ÈÀ"
@karla mdzåÊThe guy himself even came out & said it. But that could've been to get publicity :/•ÈÀ
"@keepin itreal‰ÛÜ He just wanted to be someone but no one bought it. Selena was constantly busy I doubt it, she barely had anytime to rest.•ÈÀ"
@karla mdzåÊTrue but she did go to Mexico & she did get lipo or something done from him. We'll never know the truth sadly :/ she'll always be missed•ÈÀ
Double toasted brought me here•ÈÀ
I love this film _Ù_´•ÈÀ
_ÙÕÏ•ÈÀ
Jennifer Lopez did play perfect :-)•ÈÀ
Not as beautiful as Selena was but she did do an awesome job•ÈÀ
"I do not know at all this film and this story, in any case JLO and unrecognizable, I think I will watch this movie.•ÈÀ"
keepin itreal shes every bit as beautiful _Ùªã_Ùªã•ÈÀ
and all that dreams ended because of one selfish lady.. oh god..•ÈÀ
Anchu it's so sad I litteraly bawled so hard when I heard her story recently..... I just wish I lived during the time of these musical legends lost•ÈÀ
+Anchu a hateful woman with an ugly obsession•ÈÀ
"Anchu Yolanda said that she would never take anything from Selena, but she took her life away.•ÈÀ"
Anchu I hope she gets punished in prison _Ù÷Á•ÈÀ
Anchu i remember in junior high (96-97) 6th grade to be exact. we were studying mexican american influences in spanish. there was one girl who had an aunt in prison told us everyone in that prison was ready to shank yolanda at any given opportunity.•ÈÀ
"Take The Bait it was something, she was bigger in spanish communities more so than English but her popularity  in texas was immeasurable school let out early when she was shot i was in 4th grade at the time•ÈÀ"
"SkiptyDooSir I think she was  getting more and more famous. If she hadn't been killed, I think she would have become a Latin superstar like Shakira and Jennifer Lopez, but long before them.•ÈÀ"
Every time I watch it I cry•ÈÀ
outerspacefan sadly she's almost out of prison and for sure she isn't gonna last alive one minute after she's out•ÈÀ
"JS isn't getting out bc she still denies it was intentional. Anyway it would be unsafe to let her out. As for SELENA's popularity. She may have been a lot more known in the Latin Music world but others knew of her music also including myself. SELENA was already a Superstar in her own right yet she was so humble and didn't see herself this way. At an after Grammy interview, all she could talk about was the many stars she saw and wanted to meet. Lol. The interviewer was like, SELENA you are a star. Y'all should check out Rocking Roll James YouTube Channel. He did many interviews with SELENA. _ÙÕ•ÈÀ"
She fulfilled her dream though. People still dress as her and listen to her music.•ÈÀ
jennifer did an amazing job what an inspiration•ÈÀ
She's not as beautiful as Selena was but she nailed the part of her•ÈÀ
keepin itreal YES Jennifer is beautiful in her own way. _Ù÷Ä_ÙÕø•ÈÀ
keepin itreal Your kidding me. Both are stunning women.•ÈÀ
Sean Speaks he keeps repeating the same comment fuckin annoying•ÈÀ
Classic!!! _ÙÔ•ÈÀ

STAR DUCK face selenaq•ÈÀ
"Song after song was awesome. This movie made the world outside her fanbase find her music, myself included.•ÈÀ"
"Me, too. We watched this film in my high school Spanish class and I was shocked I'd never heard of her before (I was seven when she died). I immediately did more research on her when I got home from school that day and fell in love with her music and how bright and loving she seemed to be as a person. If only she were still here. RIP, Selena.•ÈÀ"
