[movie_analysis](https://github.com/tmaxdillon/movie-gender-sentiment-analysis/tree/master/movie_analysis) folder contains the python codes for the entire process. 

## Computing Diversity Score
Use [diversity_score_module.py] (https://github.com/tmaxdillon/movie-gender-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/movie_analysis/diversity_score_module.py) to compute the diversity score of a selection of movies from IMDB data, do analytics on the dataset and extract a subset of the movies for further analysis.

### Computing Diversity Score
def computing_diversity_score
Run this function in a for loop on IMDB JSON data to extract cast and gender information for a collection of movies.
Inputs: Cast in list format (extracted from JSON), wanttoweight (bool) that toggles whether lead roles are weighted or unweighted.
Output: Diversity score of movie, Cast size of movie

### Visualize Distribution
def viz_distribution
Run this function to produce distribution visuals for cast size and gender diversity score.
Inputs: data, type of plot (cast size or gender diversity score)
Output: (if run in notebook) figure, figure saved to separate 'Figures' folder within directory

### Getting Subset
def get_subset
Run this function to retrieve a subset of the full dataset based on gender diversity score.
Inputs: dataframe (with gender diversity score added as column), number of data strata, number of movies in the subset
Output: subset dataframe

### Example
For an example/demo on how these functions can be used, refer to [create_subset_demo.ipynb] (https://github.com/tmaxdillon/movie-gender-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/movie_analysis/create_subset.ipynb) 

## Comment Extraction: 
Use [comment_downloader.py](https://github.com/tmaxdillon/movie-gender-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/movie_analysis/comment_downloader.py) to download comments from each movie trailer.
Input: csv file containing (youtube_id, movie_id)s. The header name should be "youtube_id" and "movie_id"
Output: {movie_id}.csv which contains all the comments from each movie's trailer

### Usage 
From terminal
```bash
python comment_downloader.py input.csv
```
From another python code
```python
from comment_downloader import download_from_the_list

download_from_the_list(input) #input should be a pandas dataframe with the columns "youtube_id" and "movie_id"
```
