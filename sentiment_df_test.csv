The symbiote would take him over and he could ruin Brocks career like in the movie and it would make an epic final battle between black suited Peter and Harry. Peter thanks to the symbiote would beat Harry but in his rage would murder him. Not just kill. Murder. Realizing what he's done and all that the symbiote made him lose he could go to the church and take off the suit where Brock was below.

I think if they took out Sandman and kept it just about Venom and Harry would've been a hit like SM 1 and 2. All that time wasted on love drama and Sandman could've been developing Eddie. I mean come on they turned Spidey cries all the time and it's more about MJ and him then any of the villains or fighting them...That's the reasons for me the movie wasn't as good.•ÈÀ,0.172,0.722,0.106,-0.8221

But seriously - you shouldn't pay attention to the filler because it's just taking up space before we get back to the plot.Plus - I think the Black Suit was awesome; go see the movie purely for the awesomeness of the Black Suit.Even I don't like how Venom didn't have much screen time in the movie.

443,"@James Van Oss I love both versions equally and I hate all this fighting that is splitting fans apart. But here, I'll answer your shitty questions.TASM 2 got the worst reviews because Sony didn't know what the hell they were doing. They were planning a silly cinematic universe to compete with Marvel. Sony had good intentions with this film, it's just they didn't know what they were doing and they over-marketed this movie.TASM was canned after the second movie because, again, the people Sony are idiots. They had big plans for this movie (BIG plans). The only thing that could go wrong was if TASM2 performed poorly, and it did. They didn't know what to do and they were losing the game fast, so they allowed Marvel to borrowed the rights so that movie they could salvage their popular franchise.I really can't answer the last one, I have no idea why Sony would do such a thing. Andrew as Peter and Emma as Gwen were the best things these films had going.I'm not going to pretend TASM2 was great, because it did have huge problems. But unlike most 'fans' nowadays, I genuinely like both versions. My order from best to worst are: SM2, TASM, SM, TASM2, SM3.•ÈÀ",0.133,0.726,0.141,-0.001

I mean I heard they were gonna use the lizard in the 4th one and that sounds awesome and all. But the thing I just thought of that would make me line up no matter how bad or good the movie is, is if Carnage was in it. think about it, in the comics Carnage was the result of a small piece of Venom. And in the third film a piece of the symbiote survived unless I'm mistaken. So maybe it escaped and found Kasady and made Carnage. I would love to see that. I mean come on, Carnage is the one villain i think you couldn't ruin with a silly tone, as Kasady is an insane homicidal maniac. So the silliness would actually fit him.•ÈÀ",0.112,0.748,0.14,0.8234

But the trilogy did mot follow the comics and a lot of the story line was wrong. The Amazing SpiderMan on the other hand actually carried out the comic origin completely and was actually a really good movie. I mean Andrew Garfield did an amazing job playing Peter. His build actually fits Peter Parker's and he is actually more fit to play the character. Tobey Macquire did a really good job but he was too short and stocky to fit the body type of Peter. They are both excellent movies and they both portray Spider-Man well but I give more props to The Amazing Spider-Man for actually carrying out the comic origin and not completely derailing the story.•ÈÀ,0.013,0.734,0.253,0.9856
